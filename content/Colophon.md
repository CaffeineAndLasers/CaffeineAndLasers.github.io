# How I Update My Site

All the hard work in updating my website is taken care of by 11ty. I have a section below how I manage my 11ty templates. 

My blogposts start written in Obsidian where all my knowledge lives. Whenever I have written something that I think is worth publishing, I simply drag and drop the `.md` file to `Content` folder in my websites repo. 

If the post is just text then this is all that is needed, I compile using 11ty, Push the updates to github and the new post is up! If I have pictures in the post, these get broken in the process, so I need to manually pull each one across and re-link them. This is something I still need to figure out how to automate. 

# My 11ty Config

My 11ty config was mostly inspired by [this blogpost](https://medium.com/@tarngerine/how-the-heck-do-i-use-eleventy-the-intro-guide-i-wish-i-had-84d9b2689031). All my templates are written in liquid, and *almost* all my pages are written in Markdown, (since that is what Obsidian supports).

The general idea is to push all the "web dev" and html into my templating, so my writting can be read in plain txt. If I absolutely need to do some advanced formatting, you can still slip a bit of inline css into markdown anyway. 

# Automations / Templates I'm Proud Of

## Adding Books To My Library Page

The [`/Library`](/Library.html) page is generated automatically for me from a `json` file I update whenever I feel like adding a book. (I don't add every book I finish, only the ones I feel like talking about). This idea came from [Anhvn's Blogpost / Meta Page](https://anhvn.com/posts/2024/my-eleventy-site-setup/#media-diary). Essentially we use what eleventy calls [data files](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-global/) to act as variables in the template.

For example, here is the entry for Three Body Problem:

---
```json
  {
    "name": "The Three-Body Problem",
    "author": "Liu Cixin",
    "rating": "‚≠ê",
    "thoughts": "I never thought I would take \"Astro-socialogy\" as a serious concept before reading this. Read the whole series, seriously.",
    "date": "2023-08",
    "fiction": true,
    "coverImg": "/Assets/book-covers/three-body-problem.jpg"
  },  
```
---

There is also a tiny bit of logic in the template to turn the numeric date into a written date because I think it looks nicer. 

## Automatically generating the OPML files for my RSS Starterpacks

Much like the [`/Library`](/Library.html) my [RSS Starterpacks](/rss-starter-packs.html) are built from a `.json` file I keep in my project. The cool part is the OPML files that users can download and import into their RSS reader. To do this I created a subdirectory to keep all my OPML files in, and then a liquid template `StarterPack.opml.liquid`. From there 11ty neatly bundles up all the info from my json files into nice OPML files for my users to download. 

For example, my comics starter pack looks like this in `json`:

---

```json
    {
      "name": "Web Comics",
      "description": "Sometimes you need pictures. ",
      "feeds": [
        {
          "title": "XKCD",
          "description": "Famous webcomic amongst science types. Literally every science degree person I know loves it.",
          "xmlURL": "https://xkcd.com/rss.xml",
          "htmlURL": "https://xkcd.com"
        },
        {
          "title": "Poorly Drawn Lines",
          "description": "A webcomic with humor and wit.",
          "xmlURL": "https://poorlydrawnlines.com/feed",
          "htmlURL": "https://poorlydrawnlines.com"
        },
        {
          "title": "Saturday Morning Breakfast",
          "description": "A webcomic with a mix of science, and humor.",
          "xmlURL": "https://www.smbc-comics.com/rss.php",
          "htmlURL": "https://www.smbc-comics.com"
        },
        {
          "title": "The Oatmeal",
          "description": "One of the most famous webcomics of all time. He also made exploding kittens and unstable unicorns if you are into board games.",
          "xmlURL": "https://theoatmeal.com/feed/rss",
          "htmlURL": "https://theoatmeal.com"
        }
      ]
```

It's OPML file looks like this:

---
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<opml version="2.0">
  <head>
    <title>Web Comics RSS Feeds</title>
    <dateCreated>Tue, 13 May 2025 17:05:24 Australia/Sydney</dateCreated>

I have extra bits and pieces about webmastery that I have written in the form of blogposts


<li>
    <a href="blogs/rss.html"> How to build your own RSS Feed.</a>
    I wrote a short explainer on how to setup an RSS Feed for your own website.
</li>

    <a href="blogs/automatingYourRSS.html"> Automating Your RSS Feed.</a>
    Part 2 of the RSS Feed tutorial. I give you the code snippets to use 11ty
    to automate your RSS feed. No more hand changing the file every time you
    post a new blog.

## Resources that got me started

<li>
    <a href="https://goblin-heart.net/sadgrl/projects/layout-builder/">
        Sadgrls Layout Builder.
    </a>
    This is a great lil tool to get you a fully formed website layout in a
    single copy and paste. This is how I originally started my site, but it is 
    likely customized beyond recognition at this point.

        >Petra Pixels Tutorial on pushing your local changes to production with
        a github action.</a>
    This greatly improves on the slog of trying to updating your website via the
    Neocities web interface. I don't use neocities anymore, but I was very greatful 
    to learn this was possible from petra, and use the same idea to deploy onto github
    pages now
