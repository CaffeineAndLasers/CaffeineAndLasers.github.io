    to your interests. It is a great way to keep up to date with the latest
    research in your field.

<h2>Other Tools That I like:</h2>
<p>
    <a href="https://kill-the-newsletter.com"> Kill The Newsletter!</a> I read
    my RSS feed every day. It is where I get my news, check the ArXive and read
    the blogs of other people I follow. I have the problem that some people have
    replaced the blog with an email newsletter. I DO NOT WANT
    <strong> MORE </strong> emails in my inbox. this is where kill the newletter
    comes in. They give me an email alias to sign up for newsletters, and it
    converts each email it recieves into an RSS feed for me to view at my
    lesuire. Plus, it is free and Open Source. Thanks
