    "thoughts": "This is a complicated one to recommend. It was a bit of a slog to read, and parts of it were quite confronting. Without going too much into my own political ideology, I don't think it would be that surprising to most that I do not agree 100% with the political opinions espoused by a general of the U.S military. That said, I do think it is worth a read. Not because I agree with all the opinions of the author, but because I think it is very important for many to understand how a general of the U.S. military thinks.",

In that light I was slightly disappointed that the book was mostly biographic, with not a whole lot of economics. That said, Stevensen is a REALLY great writer. Lots of very funny anecdotes, and insights. Worth the read.",

His core thesis is that we have moved beyond capitalism, and far from the socialist utopia which many predicted would be the downfall of capitalism, we ended up with something weird, and worse than capitalism. Very compelling read, and one of the more influential in how I currently percieve the world economy.",
