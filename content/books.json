In that light I was slightly disappointed that the book was mostly biographic, with not a whole lot of economics. That said, Stevensen is a REALLY great writer. Lots of very funny anecdotes, and insights. Worth the read.",

    "rating": "‚≠ê",
    "thoughts": "Varoufakis is a surprisingly great writer. The first chapter draws an extremely compelling extended metaphor between physics and philosphy and economics which blew me away. His core thesis is that we have moved beyond capitalism, and far from the socialist utopia which many predicted would be the downfall of capitalism, we ended up with something weird, and worse than capitalism. Very compelling read, and one of the more influential in how I currently percieve the world economy.",

The book then outlines the mistakes we tend to make (and practical advice in how you could exploit those blindspots)",
