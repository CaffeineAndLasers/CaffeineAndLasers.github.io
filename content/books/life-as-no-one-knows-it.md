  This was a great read as a physicist. The book was written with quite a high level of assumed knowledge, so if thermodynamics sounds like a scary word, I might suggest reading something more accessible. For me though, the premise was very interesting and prompted me to go and read a number of the papers cited in the book. From what I can tell, the central concept of "Assembly Theory" is somewhat controversial in Astrobiology circles, so I am not sure I am fully on board with the idea, but it is very interesting to engage with and think about. The book has me thinking a lot about the distinction between systems with selection, random systems and designed systems. I may have to write another blogpost about these ideas. Maybe one about Assembly Theory as well.
