  This book is GREAT. It had me absolutley obsessed with a topic I previously knew nothing about. The book is covers the bilogoy, ecology and biotechnology of algea. It somehow had me turning pages faster I could have possibly thought given the topic. By the end I was obsessed and looking at ingredients on the back of boxes to identify the algal products inside.
