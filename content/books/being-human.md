thoughts: |
    The book promises a lot, the concept is an investigation to how biology has shaped human society and history. For a while it manages to hold up to that promise, the first few chapters are genuinely really interesting. By the midpoint of the book it starts to drag unfortunately, while the first few chapters investigate where cooperation and altruism comes from, the middle starts to talk about how disease affected colonialism, and how cognitive biases lead to poor decisions in leaders. Important? Yes. Groundbreaking? Not exactly.
