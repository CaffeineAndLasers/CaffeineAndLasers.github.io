I don't normally read a lot of buisness books, which means it was time to expand my horizons. I really enjoyed this one. Bazerman is obviously very qualified and he shares some fantastic insights. In the end my notes on the book exceeded 10,000 words, which is a rare ammount of useful information within a 200 page book. 

The book does a good job starting at a foundational level, defining reserve prices and how to determine yours, estimate others etc, and then builds up to more advanced techniques within negotation. 

The thing I really appreciated about the book was that it avoided the Macho "Winners and Losers" style of negotation that you might see with some reality TV star turned politican types. Instead he explores techniques to 
"expand the pie" through negotating across multiple dimensions and taking advantage of Comparative Advantage.

He also has a lot of very specific advice, which is appreciated. E.g. Want to know how to ask for higher pay when you only have a single job offer, check Chapter 11.
