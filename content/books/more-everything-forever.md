  This ends up feeling like one of those documentaries about flat Earth consspiracy theorests, except the nutjobs in question are Peter Theil, Sam Altman and Venture Captialists. I found it frustrating at some points because of the ammount of time it spends debunking obviously stupid ideas. It definately brought up some insights into ideology of some of these people, but the book felt a little bit too long IMHO. The ideology it describes is so incoherent that I find myself wondering how useful understanding it really is. If the actions of longtermist effective altruists are indistinguishable from a selfish asshole, then I wonder why not just apply Occam's Razor and assume they are just selfish assholes?
