  It is embarrassing for me to  admit that I work in the  "Space Industry" but I barely know anything about space history, so I picked up this one.It was one of the most compelling non-fiction books I have ever read. It felt like reading a thriller. I swear I could hear the intense music kick in once I got to the chapter about the SRB O-rings. If you know you know. At a bit over 500 pages it is a bit of a commitment, but the breadth and depth of his reasearch was fantastic.
