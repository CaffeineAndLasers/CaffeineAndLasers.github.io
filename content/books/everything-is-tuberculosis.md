  I never read John Green's YA fiction, since I was not a "YA" when I first came across it, BUT, I absolutely adored Crash Course History, and the way John thinks on Vlog Brothers. With this in mind, "Everything is Tuberculosis" is everything I hoped for. He places the diseases in the context of human history and present day human culture. He ends the book arguing that Tuberculosis used to be caused by bacterial infection, now it is caused by injustice, and it is our job to fix it.
