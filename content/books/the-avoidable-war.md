I read this at the same time as ["Negotation: The Game Has Changed"](/books/negotiation.html) and there was surprising overlap in their content. Who knew that politicans were also good negotiators? /s 

The book is kind of upsetting to read in 2026. It was written during the Biden administration and putforward his proposal at "Managed Competition" to restrict the chance of catastrophic military escalation between the U.S. and China, and highlited the 2020s as a uniquely important time to achieve this. Obviously the political landscape has change drastically since then and it is unlikely that any of his proposals will be implemented. Maybe that is why he quit as ambassador this year. 

In anycase the book is very enlightening if you are interested in how Chinese politics actually works, and a masterclass in understanding and designing effective diplomacy. (If only anywone actually listened)
