  *If you willingly read the finance stories in the news or know a bit about personal finance, you can probably skip this book. But I would highly recommend buying for any teenagers or twenty-somethings in your life. (I know I would have liked to have read it earlier in my life.) 
  
  It ends up being closer to a personal finance book than an economica book. Its insights arnt really anything I hadn't heard before, BUT it is well written, Kohler is a funny guy, and it's lessons are absolutely important (I just happened to know most of them beforehand)
  
  side note: this book also is extremely Australian and for Australian audiences. (a rare thing I'm this world). by that, I don't mean he is talking about riding your kangaroo to school, but instead he discusses reasonable rates for you superfund and how pokies impacts Aussies specifically
