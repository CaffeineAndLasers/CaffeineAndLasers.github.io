  this was a very accessible book on philosophy, i have previsoly struggled with a lot of "traditional" philosphy, e.g. netzsche and camus which who i've attempted to read several times and keep bouncing off. admittedly, when i picked it up i was expecting a self-help book, turns out it was a philosophy of mind book. very worthwile anyway.
