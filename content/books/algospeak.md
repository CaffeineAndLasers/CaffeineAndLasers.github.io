  I was maybe a little bit more educated than the target audience for the book, because I found a lot of the points made a little bit obvious, and I was waiting for new information. The book is well written however, and has a very nice flow to it. I listened to it as an audiobook, so even got to listen to Aleksik perform the accents he was describing. Aleksik seems to be more optimistic about our algorithm future than I am, and I am not sure he convinced me. (I may just be cranky and cynical however). The one point I can confidently state that I disagree with: I think Aleksik overstates the effect of accents, because I think he over-estimates the proportion of posters-to-consumers on social media. I cannot see how a micro-cultural accent can occur when the line of communication is mostly mono-directional.
