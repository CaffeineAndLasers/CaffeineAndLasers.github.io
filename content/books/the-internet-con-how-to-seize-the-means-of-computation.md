  Typically I am a very materialist (philosophically, not literally) person, and as a results this was one of the more impactful political books I have ever read. In many cases power is downstream from technology, and Doctorow expertly identifies the problems, their causes and their solutions. More than any other pice, this is a guidebook for the necessary changes to affect downstream changes.
