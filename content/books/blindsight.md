  Blindsight falls into the club with the Matrix and the Three Body Problem, of being a piece of Sci-Fi who is primarily a piece of philosophy. It is a ***crunchy*** bit of sci-fi which explores transhumanism more thoroughly than any other piece I can think of. I have more thoughts which I will save for an extended blogpost I think.
