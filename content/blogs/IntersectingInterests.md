I wanted to use this months Indie Web Carnival as an excuse for a short retrospective on one of my favourite blogposts which encapsulates many of my goals within Caffeine And Lasers, and that is my post about [Beer And Optics](./beerAndOptics.html). The theme of intersecting interests dovetails nicely with how I like to write my blog-posts. I really enjoy teaching and educating, and my favourite way of educating is taking a familiar concept, and then using science to explain why it is like that.  

Like many I was inspired and obsessed with VSauce during their prime. ANd one thing which stood out to me was a [TEDx Talk that Micheal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9hauSrihYQ) gave (before TED turned into the joke it is now) where he talks about how he gets his audience interested. The quote which sums up his pedagogical philosophy:

> The point is to bring people in with a great question, make them curious. And once they are there, accidentally teach them a whole bunch of things about the universe

But the story from that talk which stuck with me was about his very first public edutainment subject -- ketchup. He recounts the story of how he won his first competitive speaking tournament by teaching the judges about ketchup, going from its history and etymology, to its legal status, and its physics. The idea is to add as many "hooks" in as possible to find something for each unique audience which will capture them. The trick, is that every person is unique, and is susceptible to different hooks. So you need to add as many diverse hooks as possible to capture as many people as possible, in order to "give them a kick in the discovery",

VSauce blew my mind when I was younger, and has influenced how I write many of my blogs today, I take a concept which is comfortable for a lay reader -- e.g. Beer -- and then take them on a journey through history, physics and chemistry. That article wasn't unique. I used the same technique in [Why humans are humanoid shaped and why SciFi Mechs should not be](./WhyhumansarehumanoidshapedandwhySciFiMechsshouldnotbe.html), where I tried to lead people in with talking about Mechas from their favourite anime / videogame, and then use it to trick them into learning about how natural selection works, and how it shaped human biology and society. One of my earliest blogs was on the [What Science Says About Coffee Grinding](./WhatScienceSaysAboutCoffeeGrinding.html) where I attempted a similar thing. 

Re-reading my post about [Beer And Optics](./beerAndOptics.html) with the benefit of hindsight, I think I failed to introduce the subject early enough to get readers sufficiently excited about the idea optical lab equipment. If I were to re-write it (which I very well may do now), I would spend more time on the introduction to motivate the readers interest. I might do some research into the problems beer brewers had in brewing reliable beverages and some of the consequences, leading the reader through a cause and effect type relationship. 

I also think I could do a better job titling my blogposts, I think I could do a better job getting reader interest by prioritising the exciting bit, and taking on the science on the end of the title, rather than frontloading the intimidating part like I often do. 

Going back and critiquing my own posts is kind of intimidating. "Oh God I wrote like THAT!" was running through my head often, and the post isn't even 12 months old. I would like to think it is a sign that my writing is improving, but you will have to excuse me if I am too scared to re-read any of my newer posts for another little while.
