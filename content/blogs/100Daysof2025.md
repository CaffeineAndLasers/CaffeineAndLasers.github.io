Channelling the legacy of Franklin D Roosevelt, the first 100 years of Trumps presidency was seen as an important benchmark to the success at his presidency. He promised to end wars, lower cost of living, fix government efficiency and end immigration. The degree to his success was is pretty clear to any observers

In any case, I think that 100 days is a good timeline to set some medium term goals. The next 100 days will happen whether I make them count or not, so I may ass well measure them. With that out of the way, here is what is under my control, that I plan on getting done by April 10. 

## 1 Professionally

### 1.1 Finalize my intent to patent for my device.

I can't speak about my device publicly, until this form is submitted. The timeline for the actual patent is outside of my control, but submitting the notice of intent is absolutely something I can control, (and is already running late).

Anyway, I plan to submit my patent, and the second that I get approval from the lawyers I will write another blog post talking about what I do. 

### 1.2 Get my first paper up on the ArXiv, and submitted for review

I can't get into this here, (again patent), but expect more posts about my science once I get my patent complete. 

### 1.3 Finalize the experiment run for paper 2.

This experiment is *so close* to being done. I have a lot more hours booked into the lab, lets hope my prototype is finished soon.

Sorry this bit is vauge, that is patents for you. 

## 2 Health and Fitness

The year of 2025 was when I started to take my health seriously and going to the gym. But I wasn't taking it *that* seriously, I was happy to go to the gym, but I didn't change my diet at all. This lead to some rapid strength and fitness improvements, but I think I have reached the end of the easy wins. Might be time to start thinking about my diet

### 2.1 Deadlift 100Kg

This one is probably close than it seems. My strength plateaued at 90Kg and has been stuck there for a few months now. 

### 2.2. 10 reps of unassisted Chin-Ups


## Conclusions

A bit of a short one today, this is more for my public accountability than it is for your reading enjoyment. Sorry about that!
