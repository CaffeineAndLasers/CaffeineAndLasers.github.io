Its kind of wild that Quantum tech has gotten to the point where folks are sharing Open Source schematics for N-V Quantum Magnetomer's with a total BOM of >$250AUD. The construction seems (relatively) accessible as well. 

Read about it on their [Site](https://quantumvillage.org/) and their [github repo](https://github.com/QuantumVillage/UncutGem).

According to some of the authors on LinkedIn V2 may be sold as a kit to hobbyists.
