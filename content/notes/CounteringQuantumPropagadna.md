Despite being bullish on Quantum sensing applications, I have been known to be bearish on quantum computers for a few years now. This may be a bit of disillusionment from my undergrad research. 

Anyway, here is a fantastic bit of anti Quantum Propaganda that I missed from last year.

[Replication of Quantum Factorisation Records with an 8-bit Home Computer, an Abacus, and a Dog](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/1237)

It contains banger quotes like:
- The VIC-20 was a popular home computer in the 1980s that used the then popular 6502 microprocessor from 1975. Since this processor uses transistors, and transistors work by using quantum effects, a 6502 is as much a quantum device as is a D-Wave “quantum computer”. The 6502 has three 8-bit registers, an 8-bit data bus, and a 16-bit address bus, giving it a 64 KiB address space. The VIC-20 had 20 KiB ROM and 5 KiB RAM, with 3.5 KiB available for applications, and features a roughly 1 MHz clock
- As has been previously pointed out, the 2001 and 2012 quantum factorisation records may be easily matched with a dog trained to bark three times [35]. We verified this by taking a recently-calibrated reference dog, Scribble, depicted in Figure 6, and having him bark three times, thus simultaneously factorising both 15 and 21. This process wasn’t as simple as it first appeared because Scribble is very well behaved and almost never barks
- We hypothesise that the production of fully entangled sheep is easy, given how
hard it can be to disentangle their coats in the first place

Inspite of its jokes, the paper contains actual insights into how the overrepresentation of Quantum COmputing capabilities actually happens and proposes a good standard for fair benchmarking of quantum computing devices to avoid misleading headlines.
