I was doodling late at night, under some very warm light. In fact, I legitimately wasnt sure if the marker I was using was purple or black. (Glad it was purple)

<div class="art-piece">
	<img src="/Assets/purpleCheckerDoodle.jpg" alt="Purple Warped Checkboard Pattern with a red scar through it" />
</div>

<style>
.art-piece {
	margin: 1.5rem auto;
	max-width: 75%;
}

.art-piece img {
	display: block;
	width: 100%;
	height: auto;
	border-radius: 0.5rem;
}

</style>
