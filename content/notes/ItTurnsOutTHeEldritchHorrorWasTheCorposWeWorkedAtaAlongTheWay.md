I just stumbled accross an interesting paper on organisations with an abstract I just had to share. (Sections removed for emphasis, clarity and comedy)

> This paper examines how employees become simultaneously empowered and alienated by detailed, holistic knowledge of the actual operations of their organization,... As employees build and scrutinize process maps of their organization, they develop a new comprehension of the structure and operation of their organization. What they had perceived as purposively designed, relatively stable, and largely external is revealed to be continuously produced through social interaction... this altered comprehension of the organization’s functioning and logic changes employees’ orientation to and place within the organization. Their central roles are revealed as less efficacious than imagined and, in fact, as reproducing the organization's inefficiencies
