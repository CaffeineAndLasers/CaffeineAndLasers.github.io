I added an extra feature to the reddit RSS feed generator to allow users to choose what timeframe to extract top posts for. 

i.e. Top posts today/this week/this month/all time.

Shout out to Rohit at [Rohit Online](https://rohit.online/) for emailing me with the feature request. 

I am super happy to get comments / guestbook entries or emails. I purposely do not keep any viewership metrics on this site
so the only way for me to find out if you like my content is to say hello :)
