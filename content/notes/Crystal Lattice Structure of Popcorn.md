Has anyone ever studied the crystal lattice structure of a box of popcorn? Relevant research questions include:

- Do the crystal defects introduced by Peanut M&Ms increase or reduce crystal strength?
- How do Peanut M&M defects compare with other confectionry based defects (e.g. regular M&Ms, Reeces Pieces)
- Is the traditional square pyramid profile of a popcorn box optimal? or can integrity by improved by alternate geometries?

There may be an igNobel prize in this research. If you have thoughts please email me. I am only kind of joking about this.
