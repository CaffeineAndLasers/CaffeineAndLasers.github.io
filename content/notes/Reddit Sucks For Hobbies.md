It's frustrating that nearly every niche interest and hobby's main online community exists on Reddit, because Reddit is fucking terrible for fostering genuine communities.

If you go into any subreddit - I will pick on /r/3DPrinting for now - at least 50% of the posts are either "Look at my very first print" or "Help me debug this issue" (They absolutely did not google it before asking for help on reddit). 

While there is nothing *inherently* wrong with introducing yourself to the community or asking for help, that's not what keeps experienced members engaged in the community. So you have all these newbie posts polluting the online community frustrating people who want to have deeper discussions about the hobby. And it isn't the newbies fault either, newbies need somewhere to share space with experienced people to get that experience.

Is this some unsolvable fact of life about online communities? **NO!**

Traditional forums solved this by making separate threads for _introductions_ and _help threads_ and _memes / off topic_. We didn't just throw everything into one big list and wish you luck. 

Anyway, can we go back to forums? I'm so sick of reddit man.
