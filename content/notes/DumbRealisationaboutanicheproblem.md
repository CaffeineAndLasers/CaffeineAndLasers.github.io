Just wanted to share a quick solution I realised about my relationship to "short form content". In general I do not consume (or at least try my best not to consume) short form / vertical videos. Too addictive, don't want to wastew the time on it. 

but....

There are a handful of creators who do thoughtful shortform vids I really like. Namely [EtymologyNerd](https://www.youtube.com/@etymology_nerd) and [Chris Kohler News](https://www.youtube.com/@ChrisKohlerNews/shorts)

what do?

Then I remembered that whole YouTube has hidden RSS feeds, and all these creators post to YouTube Shorts as well. So I just sub there and watch in my RSS "reader". 

Yes, it is garish watching vertical aspect ratio on a computer, but, it seriously removes the temptation to even open youtube shorts when I know I've already seen the good ones. 

Try it out if you are trying to remove your TikTok addiction, but don't want to "miss out" on your favourite creators.
