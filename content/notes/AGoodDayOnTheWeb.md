description: Today was a good day for me on the internet. I was struggling with a design for a hobby project I am in the planning stages of, so i hit up the Laser Pointer Forum asking for advice on how to build a particular piece of kit. The helpful folks there pointed me to The Laser Cookbook by Gordon McComb, so I gave it a search and it was avaliable to borrow on the Internet Archive's Website! And had exact instructions to for what I was trying to build. Sometimes the internet is just great!

Today was a good day for me on the internet. I was struggling with a design for a hobby project I am in the planning stages of, so i hit up the [Laser Pointer Forum](https://laserpointerforums.com/) asking for advice on how to build a particular piece of kit. The helpful folks there pointed me to [The Laser Cookbook : 88 practical projects by Gordon McComb](https://archive.org/details/lasercookbook88p0000mcco/page/122/mode/2up), so I gave it a search and it was avaliable to borrow on the Internet Archive's Website! And had exact instructions to for what I was trying to build. Sometimes the internet is just great!
