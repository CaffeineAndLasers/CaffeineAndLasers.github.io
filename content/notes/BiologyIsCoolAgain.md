Is a deep sea sponge that grows between 500m - 1km underwater (although it can be found as shallow as 100m), and is MADE OF GLASS.

Even cooler than the fact that this sponge manages to grow glass biologically while underwater, [IT TURNS THE GLASS FILAMENTS INTO SINGLE MODE OPTIC FIBERS](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Micha-Ilan/publication/10603716_Fiber-_optical_Features_of_a_Glass_Sponge/links/00b7d533c042ed2b87000000/Fiber-optical-Features-of-a-Glass-Sponge.pdf?origin=publication_detail&_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7ImZpcnN0UGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uIiwicGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uRG93bmxvYWQiLCJwcmV2aW91c1BhZ2UiOiJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbiIsInBvc2l0aW9uIjoiZ2xvYmFsRm9vdGVyIn19) This was presented back in a 2003 nature article.
