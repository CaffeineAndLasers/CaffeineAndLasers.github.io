*The following is a paraphrased exerpt from Mark Rowland's book "The Happiness of Dogs". I haven't finished it yet, but even from chapter one I would reccomend it.* 

Okay, so according to Camus, in order to understand life's meaning:"  imagine Sisyphus Happy". Most reasonable people will respond, "but how" after all, repetition is the practically the definition of boring

"Well let me tell you about my dog" says Mark Rowlands

Every day I take him for a walk along the canals. And every day he runs along the bank, scaring the local iguanas to the other side of the canal, where they will stay until the next morning, and my dog will repeat the task.
Not only does my dog accept his iguana herding duties with zeal, it seems to be his favorite part of the day

***"Finding meaning in life is difficult for us, but easy for dogs. The consequences of this insight are profound and unsettling"*** (Actual quote)
