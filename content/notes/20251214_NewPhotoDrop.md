I am not an artist by any means. But, after watching [Stuthless video on getting unstuck from a creative rut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2n8W6CBxc64&pp=ygUVc3RydXRobGVzcyBjcmVhdGl2aXR5) I decided it could be fun to walk down to the park and mess around with some art.

First up was a tea-stain map. I threw tea onto a piece of paper and turned it into a map for some fictional fantasy empire.
<div class="art-piece rotate-left">
	<img src="/Assets/asdfcawe.jpg" alt="Tea-stain map sketch of a fictional fantasy empire" />
</div>

Then I tried to draw a circle, failed, turned it into an onion.
<div class="art-piece rotate-left">
	<img src="/Assets/qwerca.jpg" alt="Onion doodle born from a failed circle sketch" />
</div>

**Go Onion!** 

(10 points to anyone who knows the reference)

My partner who actually does know how to draw and paint had a bit more success than me:
<div class="art-piece">
	<img src="/Assets/fdsa.jpg" alt="Skeleton Doctor" />
</div>
<div class="art-piece rotate-right">
	<img src="/Assets/asfd.jpg" alt="Some colours n shit" />
</div>

<style>
.art-piece {
	margin: 1.5rem auto;
	max-width: 75%;
}

.art-piece img {
	display: block;
	width: 100%;
	height: auto;
	border-radius: 0.5rem;
}

.art-piece.rotate-left {
	max-width: 75%;
	aspect-ratio: 1;
	display: flex;
	align-items: center;
	justify-content: center;
	overflow: visible;
}

.art-piece.rotate-left img {
	transform: rotate(-90deg);
	width: 100%;
	max-width: none;
}

.art-piece.rotate-right {
	max-width: 75%;
	aspect-ratio: 1;
	display: flex;
	align-items: center;
	justify-content: center;
	overflow: visible;
}

.art-piece.rotate-right img {
	transform: rotate(90deg);
	width: 100%;
	max-width: none;
}
</style>
