Quiet few months. Turns out my RSS feed was broken. Sorry for the spam of todays three posts.

Two Important Updates:

1. I fixed the RSS functionality of my site. If you missed anything from this year, feel free to go back and read my older articles

2. I added multiple feeds to my site. This one (the one you are probably subscribed to if you are reading this in your RSS reader), combines my blogposts, and shorter notes and links. If you are interested in subscribing to JUST my longform blogs, you can grab that link from my page. (Ditto for just my notes).

Thanks!
