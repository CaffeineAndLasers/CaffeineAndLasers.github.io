<h1>Notes</h1>
<p><strong>This is where I put all my notes</strong>
These are bits and pieces which are either too short, or not original
enough to be a blog post. In here you will find links to other bits of the web I find
interesting, random thoughts and pictures I might want to share.</p>

<p>If you want to keep track, my notes are in a separate <a href="/feeds/notes.xml">RSS feed</a>.</p>

  All my notes and pictures are licensed under Creative Commons 0 (CC0) license unless otherwise stated.
