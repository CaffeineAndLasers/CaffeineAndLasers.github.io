<h1>Feeds</h1>

<p>Right now my content is split into two feeds: Blogs and Notes. And you can subscribe to either or both.</p>

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: space-between;">
    <ul style="flex: 2; margin-right: 1px;">
        <li><strong>All:</strong> Subscribe to this for everything I write. <a href="/feed.xml">Subscribe</a></li>
        <li><strong>Blogs:</strong> These are my longform posts, the thoughts here are mostly researched, mostly my own opinion, mostly good. <a href="/feeds/blogs.xml">Subscribe</a></li>
        <li><strong>Notes:</strong> These are things that are too short or too unoriginal to be blogposts. They include links to sites I like, pictures I take, or responses I have to other writings. <a href="/feeds/notes.xml">Subscribe</a></li>
    </ul>
