<h1>My Book Library</h1>

<p>
  Welcome to the library! This is something along the lines
  of my personal "Goodreads". I am a chronic people pleaser
  so a standerd out of 10 rating will never work for me. 
</p>

<p> 
    Instead I have a very simple rating system,    
</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li> 
        üü• - <b>I actively disliked it.</b> You wont find many of these, since if
        I don't like a book I will just stop reading it, and even if I do 
        finish reading it, I probably don't feel like writing about it.
    </li>
    <li> 
        üüß - <b>Its decent.</b> I finished it, I probably enjoyed it 
        but I wont go so far as to recommend it.
    </li>
    <li> 
        üü© - <b>I reccomend It.</b> I enjoyed it, and I would recommend it to others.
    </li>
    <li>
        ‚≠ê - <b>It changed me.</b> This one is reserved for books that I can 
        point to exactly how they changed me. These are the books that I will
        be thinking about for years to come.
    </li>
  </ul>

        <p class="book-thoughts"><strong>Thoughts:</strong> This is a complicated one to recommend. It was a bit of a slog to read, and parts of it were quite confronting. Without going too much into my own political ideology, I don't think it would be that surprising to most that I do not agree 100% with the political opinions espoused by a general of the U.S military. That said, I do think it is worth a read. Not because I agree with all the opinions of the author, but because I think it is very important for many to understand how a general of the U.S. military thinks.</p>

        <p class="book-thoughts"><strong>Thoughts:</strong> Varoufakis is a surprisingly great writer. The first chapter draws an extremely compelling extended metaphor between physics and philosphy and economics which blew me away. His core thesis is that we have moved beyond capitalism, and far from the socialist utopia which many predicted would be the downfall of capitalism, we ended up with something weird, and worse than capitalism. Very compelling read, and one of the more influential in how I currently percieve the world economy.</p>
