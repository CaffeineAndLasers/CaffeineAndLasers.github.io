<h1>My Book Library</h1>

<p>
  Welcome to the library! This is something along the lines
  of my personal "Goodreads". I am a chronic people pleaser
  so a standerd out of 10 rating will never work for me. 
</p>

<p> 
    Instead I have a very simple rating system,    
</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li> 
        🟥 - <b>I actively disliked it.</b> You wont find many of these, since if
        I don't like a book I will just stop reading it, and even if I do 
        finish reading it, I probably don't feel like writing about it.
    </li>
    <li> 
        🟧 - <b>Its decent.</b> I finished it, I probably enjoyed it 
        but I wont go so far as to recommend it.
    </li>
    <li> 
        🟩 - <b>I recommend It.</b> I enjoyed it, and I would recommend it to others.
    </li>
    <li>
        ⭐ - <b>It changed me.</b> This one is reserved for books that I can 
        point to exactly how they changed me. These are the books that I will
        be thinking about for years to come.
    </li>
  </ul>

        <p class="book-thoughts"><strong>Thoughts:</strong> It is embarrassing for me to  admit that I work in the  "Space Industry" but I barely know anything about space history, so I picked up this one.It was one of the most compelling non-fiction books I have ever read. It felt like reading a thriller. I swear I could hear the intense music kick in once I got to the chapter about the SRB O-rings. If you know you know. At a bit over 500 pages it is a bit of a commitment, but the breadth and depth of his reasearch was fantastic.</p>

        <p class="book-thoughts"><strong>Thoughts:</strong> *If you willingly read the finance stories in the news or know a bit about personal finance, you can probably skip this book. But I would highly recommend buying for any teenagers or twenty-somethings in your life. (I know I would have liked to have read it earlier in my life.) 

It ends up being closer to a personal finance book than an economica book. Its insights arnt really anything I hadn't heard before, BUT it is well written, Kohler is a funny guy, and it's lessons are absolutely important (I just happened to know most of them beforehand)

side note: this book also is extremely Australian and for Australian audiences. (a rare thing I'm this world). by that, I don't mean he is talking about riding your kangaroo to school, but instead he discusses reasonable rates for you superfund and how pokies impacts Aussies specifically</p>

        <p class="book-thoughts"><strong>Thoughts:</strong> This ends up feeling like one of those documentaries about flat Earth consspiracy theorests, except the nutjobs in question are Peter Theil, Sam Altman and Venture Captialists. I found it frustrating at some points because of the ammount of time it spends debunking obviously stupid ideas. It definately brought up some insights into ideology of some of these people, but the book felt a little bit too long IMHO. The ideology it describes is so incoherent that I find myself wondering how useful understanding it really is. If the actions of longtermist effective altruists are indistinguishable from a selfish asshole, then I wonder why not just apply Occam's Razor and assume they are just selfish assholes?</p>

        <p class="book-thoughts"><strong>Thoughts:</strong> This was a great read as a physicist. The book was written with quite a high level of assumed knowledge, so if thermodynamics sounds like a scary word, I might suggest reading something more accessible. For me though, the premise was very interesting and prompted me to go and read a number of the papers cited in the book. From what I can tell, the central concept of "Assembly Theory" is somewhat controversial in Astrobiology circles, so I am not sure I am fully on board with the idea, but it is very interesting to engage with and think about. The book has me thinking a lot about the distinction between systems with selection, random systems and designed systems. I may have to write another blogpost about these ideas. Maybe one about Assembly Theory as well.</p>

        <p class="book-thoughts"><strong>Thoughts:</strong> I was maybe a little bit more educated than the target audience for the book, because I found a lot of the points made a little bit obvious, and I was waiting for new information. The book is well written however, and has a very nice flow to it. I listened to it as an audiobook, so even got to listen to Aleksik perform the accents he was describing. Aleksik seems to be more optimistic about our algorithm future than I am, and I am not sure he convinced me. (I may just be cranky and cynical however). The one point I can confidently state that I disagree with: I think Aleksik overstates the effect of accents, because I think he over-estimates the proportion of posters-to-consumers on social media. I cannot see how a micro-cultural accent can occur when the line of communication is mostly mono-directional.</p>

        <p class="book-thoughts"><strong>Thoughts:</strong> I never read John Green's YA fiction, since I was not a "YA" when I first came across it, BUT, I absolutely adored Crash Course History, and the way John thinks on Vlog Brothers. With this in mind, "Everything is Tuberculosis" is everything I hoped for. He places the diseases in the context of human history and present day human culture. He ends the book arguing that Tuberculosis used to be caused by bacterial infection, now it is caused by injustice, and it is our job to fix it.</p>

        <p class="book-thoughts"><strong>Thoughts:</strong> Fair warning, this is straight up propaganda (it even had to pass MI5 clearance to publish) and is written like Tom Clancy. Nonetheless, it was really enjoyable to read. The narrative of it is mostly in the form of radio chatter which is a form I personally find gripping. Also kind of terrrifying to think how many terror plots get stopped, but it restored some level of my faith in instituitions to see the principaled stance that Tom and his team operated within.</p>

It is a ***crunchy*** bit of sci-fi which explores transhumanism more thoroughly than any other piece I can think of. I have more thoughts which I will save for an extended blogpost I think. </p>

        <p class="book-thoughts"><strong>Thoughts:</strong> This is a complicated one to recommend. It was a bit of a slog to read, and parts of it were quite confronting. Without going too much into my own political ideology, I don't think it would be that surprising to most that I do not agree 100% with the political opinions espoused by a general of the U.S military. That said, I do think it is worth a read. Not because I agree with all the opinions of the author, but because I think it is very important for many to understand how a general of the U.S. military thinks.</p>

        <p class="book-thoughts"><strong>Thoughts:</strong> Varoufakis is a surprisingly great writer. The first chapter draws an extremely compelling extended metaphor between physics and philosphy and economics which blew me away. His core thesis is that we have moved beyond capitalism, and far from the socialist utopia which many predicted would be the downfall of capitalism, we ended up with something weird, and worse than capitalism. Very compelling read, and one of the more influential in how I currently percieve the world economy.</p>
