<h1>Observing the observer: Perception in Philosophy Psychology and Physics</h1>
<p><strong>What Do Descarte, Buddhists and Astrophysicists have in common?</strong></p>
<h1>The Answer?</h1>
<p>To give a short answer. Fundamental appreciation of one's own<br>
epistemologic limitations and an understanding of the self-referential<br>
nature of perceiving one's existence.</p>
<p>In non-jargon: They pay attention to what they are paying attention to.<br>
In order to better understand this, lets take a brief tour through<br>
philosphy, psychology and astrophysics.</p>
<h1>Descartes Says: &quot;Cogito, Ergo Sum&quot; {#cogito-ergo-sum}</h1>
<p><em>I think therefore I am</em></p>
<p>A famous line everyone has heard before. Let's cover what Descartes<br>
meant by this.</p>
<p>Descartes was a <em>Skeptic</em>. He wanted to answer the question &quot;What can I<br>
know for SURE&quot;. While this seems simple, it reveals some deeper<br>
questions. Can you trust your eyes? What about opical illusions? Can you<br>
trust your ears? What if you are hallucinating? If we cant trust our<br>
senses, what can we trust?</p>
<p>This question drove him insane until he came to one very important<br>
discovery.</p>
<p><em>Cogito, Ergo Sum - I think therefore I am</em></p>
<p>What this means, is that while we can doubt our knowledge, our eyes,<br>
ears and smell, we cannot doubt our own existence. Because any doubt<br>
itself is proof of our own existence.</p>
<p>This is such a profound statement, because stating it itself, is proof<br>
that it is not false. Even if you doubt your senses or your reasoning,<br>
it must still be true.</p>
<p>From this observation, Descartes (and thousands of philosophers after<br>
him) tried (and failed) to axiomatically reconstruct all of human<br>
knowledge. This fundamental axiom remains unchanged. You exist, because<br>
you can observe yourself.</p>
<h1>Anthropic principle</h1>
<p>In 1973, Brandon Carter changed astrophysics forever when he coined the<br>
&quot;Anthropic principle&quot;. This principle states that the fact that <em>we</em><br>
exist, is a necessary condition for us to make observations about the<br>
universe. This means that the range of observations that could be made<br>
about the universe is limited by the fact that observations can only be<br>
made within a universe capable of creating intelligent observers. An<br>
excellent anaology is to consider a sentient puddle of water, who is<br>
amazed at how perfectly the hole it is in fits it. The puddle's<br>
misconception is that the hole was made for it, when in reality, the<br>
puddle was made out of the hole.</p>
<p>This principle starts to explain why it seems like the universe is<br>
finely tuned to produce life. That is because, if it wasn't, we<br>
wouldn't be here to notice it. It puts limits on the physical<br>
constants, the age of the universe and possibly why we haven't found<br>
aliens.</p>
<p>For example, why is the universe as old as it is? If it were a tenth of<br>
its current age, there would not be enough metal in the universe to<br>
sustain intelligent life. If it were ten times its current age there<br>
would not be enough active stars alive in the universe to maintain human<br>
life. Therefore, it is no coincidence that we live in a universal golden<br>
age. If we weren't then we wouldn't exist to notice that it is a<br>
golden age.</p>
<p>The anthropic principle is invoked many times in astrophysics to explain<br>
the remarkable coincidences we see in nature.</p>
<h1>Mindfulness</h1>
<p>Mental health practitioners, Buddhists, and plenty of wise people<br>
recommend mindfulness for managing anxiety and depression. This practice<br>
emphasizes observing one's thoughts and feelings from a detached<br>
perspective. It implicitly recognizes the existence of a conscious<br>
observer separate from the contents of consciousness.</p>
<p>In practice, a mindfulness exercise involves letting yourself feel<br>
emotions and experience thoughts while observing those emotions and<br>
thoughts from a detached perspective.</p>
<p>This is sometimes called meta-attention. Paying attention to your<br>
attention. The aim of practising meta-attention is to decouple your<br>
consciousness from your observations and thereby break the thought loops<br>
that cause anxiety and depression.</p>
<p>Mindfulness extends from the Buddhist and Hindu traditions and is backed<br>
by modern cognitive psychology. The practice of observing one's<br>
thoughts as the physical process of natural laws is a powerful tool for<br>
understandng ones place in the universe.</p>
<h1>So what ties these things together?</h1>
<p>The common thread linking these three concepts is the acknowledgment of<br>
consciousness or subjective experience as a fundamental starting point<br>
for understanding reality.</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Epistemological starting point</strong>: All three ideas recognize that<br>
our subjective experience is the starting point for knowledge. We<br>
can't step outside our consciousness to view reality<br>
&quot;objectively.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Self-referential nature</strong>: Each concept involves a kind of<br>
self-reference. Mindfulness observes the observer, Descartes uses<br>
thought to prove the thinker, and the Anthropic Principle considers<br>
observers observing the conditions for their own existence.</li>
<li><strong>Limits of knowledge</strong>: All three ideas implicitly acknowledge the<br>
limitations of what we can know. Mindfulness reveals the constructed<br>
nature of our experiences through our senses and Descartes'<br>
scepticism provides a starting block to build our knowledge off of.<br>
Finally, the Anthropic Principle reminds us that our observations<br>
are inherently biased by our own existence.</li>
<li><strong>Importance of perspective</strong>: Each concept emphasizes the role of<br>
the observer's perspective. Mindfulness shifts perspective,<br>
Descartes isolates a singular perspective, and the Anthropic<br>
Principle accounts for the observer's perspective in cosmological<br>
theories.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Where else does the role of the observer come up in study?</h1>
<h2>Plato's Cave</h2>
<p>Plato's Cave is a philosophical parable that addresses the nature of<br>
reality and human perception. It is another concept very relevant to<br>
these concepts of observability. The allegory is summarised :</p>
<ol>
<li>Prisoners are chained in a cave, facing a wall. They have lived<br>
facing this wall their entire life..</li>
<li>Behind them, a fire casts shadows on the wall from objects passing<br>
in front of it.</li>
<li>The prisoners can only see these shadows and believe them to be<br>
reality.</li>
<li>If a prisoner is freed and sees the true world outside the cave,<br>
they would at first be confused and disbelieving.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/An_Illustration_of_The_Allegory_of_the_Cave%2C_from_Plato%E2%80%99s_Republic.jpg" alt="Platos
Cave" title="Plato's Cave"></p>
<p>Copyright: Wikimedia Commons. 2018. Sharealike license</p>
<p>The lesson we learn from Plato's Cave is to consider how our perception<br>
limits our understanding of the universe. Plato argues that the<br>
philosopher is like the prisoner who escapes the cave to understand the<br>
world, while the unenlightened are content not knowing even what they do<br>
not know.</p>
<p>Plato's cave also prompts us to consider our own subjective existence<br>
in relation to our observations of the universe. Much like the prisoners<br>
mistake shadows for reality, mindfulness encourages us to not mistake<br>
our own thoughts and feelings for reality.</p>
<h2>Heisenberg Uncertainty Principal</h2>
<p>While less philosophically dense, Quantum mechanics is another topic<br>
which centres observability within its epistemic framework. Quantum<br>
mechanics centres the role of the observer within it via the Heisenberg<br>
Uncertainty principle.</p>
<p>This principle places a limit on what we can know because the action of<br>
making an observation itself will affect the state of the thing we are<br>
observing. Mathematically this is expressed as:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdisplaystyle%20%5CDelta%20x%20%5CDelta%20p%20%5Cgeq%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Chbar%7D%7B2%7D" alt="Delta x Delta p geq
frac{hbar}{2}" title="\Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}"></p>
<p>This means, that the more precisely we know a particle's position<br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20x" alt="x" title="x"><br>
, the less precisely we know its<br>
momentum<br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20p" alt="p" title="p"><br>
and vice versa. This is because<br>
to figure out a particle's location, you need to interact with it in<br>
some way. This interaction affects its momentum.</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics even encodes the act of observing as a mathematical<br>
operation, expressed as a bra<br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20%5Clangle%7BO%7D%7C" alt="langle{O}" title="\langle{O}|"><br>
and &quot;reality&quot; as a ket<br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20%7C%7BR%7D%5Crangle" alt="{R}rangle" title="|{R}\rangle"><br>
. The observation of reality is<br>
calculated as a probability by multiplying the two:<br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20%5Clangle%7BO%7D%7C%7BR%7D%5Crangle%20%3D%20p%28O%29" alt="langle{O}{R}rangle =
p(O)" title="\langle{O}|{R}\rangle = p(O)"></p>
<h1>Concluding thoughts</h1>
<p>To be completely honest, I don't know how to tie this blog post<br>
together, other than noticing the interesting pattern of the role of the<br>
observer in so many different fields.The act of decoupling the concept<br>
of observing from understanding true reality, we have made strides in a<br>
wide range of fields, from philosophy, and psychology to astrophysics,<br>
and quantum physics.</p>
<p>If you can tie this idea of perceptibility to your own work let me know,<br>
either email me or hit me up on mastodon, because I am very interested<br>
to see where else it has come up. I hope to write a future blog post<br>
tying the concept of perceptibility to determinism and free will. So<br>
stay tuned for that!</p>
