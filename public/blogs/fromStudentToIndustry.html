<h1>From Student To Industry</h1>
<p>Good afternoon everyone, my name is Cameron, I am a somewhat recent hire<br>
at Finisar, so I was sitting in your seat only a few years ago. Today I<br>
am going to talk about some of the things I noticed going from studying<br>
to working, some of the things I found helped with the transition and<br>
finding a job in industry and some of the things I might've done<br>
differently if I was going to do it again.</p>
<p>So to begin with, I want to talk about some of the differences I've<br>
noticed moving from being a student in academia to working in industry<br>
so that you have the right idea about what to expect.</p>
<p>The biggest difference I've noticed after moving from being a science<br>
student to working in industry is the shear breadth of things I need to<br>
do. If your science degree is anything like mine was, an average day was</p>
<ol>
<li>Sit in a lecture</li>
<li>Write some Notes</li>
<li>Write some MATLAB</li>
<li>Send one email,</li>
<li>Take more notes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Working as an engineer I find myself still doing lots of math and<br>
writing lots of software, but I'm also debugging electronic circuit<br>
boards, setting up experiments, designing metalwork, designing<br>
packaging, troubleshooting for customers and all kinds of related tasks.<br>
On the other hand, I also spend a LOT more time, filling in paperwork,<br>
answering emails, filling in more paperwork and also getting my hands<br>
dirty with the production crew make sure product <em>actually</em> gets out the<br>
door.</p>
<p>So there are pros and cons to it like anything, in both academia and<br>
industry there are plenty of time wasting tasks to get through, but<br>
having a physical product that you can hold in your hands and sell to<br>
customers for money I find to be really quite rewarding about working in<br>
industry. Especially after spending so many years where the sum of my<br>
work was a grade sheet at the end of semester.</p>
<p>On the hand, the other consequence of working on a physical product, is<br>
it actually needs to work. Every Time. When your in the lab your<br>
experiment only needs to work long enough to take your measurements, but<br>
for a physical product it needs to work every day, at a wide temperature<br>
range and under all kinds on conditions. Finding and addressing the<br>
corner cases in your products is its own special breed of hair pulling<br>
out.</p>
<p>So now I want to talk about what was useful an d useless that I got out<br>
of my degree.</p>
<p>It should go without saying that the foundations of mathematics and the<br>
skills associated with it are critical for understanding the underlying<br>
principals of any product you might design. Unfortunately, about 90% of<br>
the content you learn in math is useless. And I say that without<br>
exaggeration. I have not done a single proof since graduating. That is<br>
not to say that your math classes are useless, I often find myself<br>
writing software to implement some algorithm or another, which requires<br>
a good grasp on the elements of linear algebra, calculus, differential<br>
equations and all that other good stuff. The point I am trying to make<br>
here, is that a solid understanding of the fundamentals and how to apply<br>
them are a lot more useful than the expertise in any particular area of<br>
mathematics.</p>
<p>On a similar note, the lab sessions in my undergrad course were a lot<br>
more useful than I gave them credit for at the time.</p>
<p>There is the great saying <em>&quot;The difference between theory and practice,<br>
is greater in practice than in theory&quot;</em> And in engineering, a<br>
theoretical product doesn't get you very far. ( Unless you work for a<br>
Silicon Valley start up :P )</p>
<p>The point is, knowing how to use the tools of the trade and set up an<br>
experiment is one of the more useful things that your degree will<br>
directly teach you. Messing around with lasers, electronics,<br>
oscilloscopes and whatever else is in your lab is the most expensive<br>
part of your degree. So try to get your money's worth.</p>
<p>Now I want to talk about what I did right, and what I wish I did<br>
differently.</p>
<p>For one, I think the most valuable part of my degree of all my work was<br>
the open-ended research opportunities. I was fortunate enough to get the<br>
chance to do different research projects before starting my honors<br>
research. And even though none of this work nearly of publishable<br>
quality, this is where I learnt to work independently, and problem solve<br>
without the benefit of textbooks or lecturers who I could go to for<br>
clues. It also gave me some projects which I could talk when I was<br>
applying for jobs which differentiated me from the pack. If you have<br>
done primary research on a topic that's something an interviewer can ask<br>
you about and you can use it as an excuse to exercise your communication<br>
skills to talk about how you lead a project working independently (or in<br>
a team) and got actionable data from. See how many job keywords I<br>
slipped in there? So my recommendation, any chance you get to do some<br>
open ended research, jump on it!</p>
<p>For what I wish I did differently, I wish that I had got my hands dirty<br>
with a few more physical projects. Now in the <em><strong>unprecedented times</strong></em><br>
of covid, I found some of my <em>non-theoretical</em> skills were lacking, and<br>
that was a steep learning curve for me upon entering engineering.<br>
Labwork really helps here, but it was not quite enough. And if I might<br>
give some specific advice; if you are worried your physical skills are<br>
lacking like mine were, go buy yourself an Arduino Starter kit, they're<br>
relatively cheap and you can go get some experience with circuitry,<br>
embedded software, and project design. I also happen to think they're<br>
quite fun to tinker with, but it's VERY useful to have a physical<br>
<strong>THING</strong> you can say you made when applying to jobs. Remember, industry<br>
cares about selling things, not your grades.</p>
<p>Another idea for something to differentiate yourself from the pack. If<br>
you are a software person, consider contributing to an open-source<br>
project, even if its just correcting some typos in the documentation to<br>
start off with,</p>
<p>Having something of a portfolio you can show at an interview is<br>
invaluable, whether it is a physical <strong>thing</strong> you made, software you<br>
wrote or research you produced, having something unique that you did<br>
speaks a lot louder than the grades you get on your exams and assignment<br>
worksheets.</p>
<p>Another thing to put in the win column was all the hours I spent hanging<br>
out in the engineering department. I noticed very early on in my degree,<br>
that although I was studying pure science, the engineers always threw<br>
way better parties. So naturally that is where I spent all my free time.<br>
Now in addition to learning about the deep rivalry between mechanical<br>
and aeronautical engineering and deep philosophical questions such as<br>
&quot;Is civil engineering, really a type of engineering?&quot; spending time with<br>
this cohort was invaluable to my development.</p>
<p>This all boils down to idea cross-pollination, by making sure I was<br>
speaking to people outside of my department, I was exposing myself to<br>
more ideas. This meant I was better able to talk to people outside of my<br>
specialty, - (seriously, if you can't explain what it is your studying<br>
to a lay person, you will have problems explaining to an interviewer why<br>
they should hire you). - I was also able to get a better idea of what<br>
technologies other people were using and what scientific problems really<br>
need solving. For the engineers, speaking to us scientists they get some<br>
nice spoilers for upcoming technology and new ideas for development. So,<br>
the benefits really goes both ways.</p>
<p>Now while I've focused on our friends in engineering, I this idea<br>
generalizes quite broadly, if you want to know what products make a<br>
business profitable and which are a big-time waster, you're probably<br>
going to have to speak to the business students. There are fantastic<br>
ideas coming out of the mathematics and computer science departments<br>
every day which make for more useful research tools, and if you want to<br>
know what life is really worth living for, I guess that's what the arts<br>
department is for. Idea cross pollination and diversity of thought and<br>
mindset are incredibly important for your development professionally,<br>
the ideas you come up with and for your general social and emotional<br>
wellbeing.</p>
<p>To summarize the first half on my presentation, here are some action<br>
points: - Working in industry you may find yourself doing a much broader<br>
variety of tasks, but just as many time-wasting tasks - At the end of<br>
the day, you end up with a physical thing you can hold in your hands and<br>
sell for money, which I think is rewarding, however your milage may<br>
vary. - Math knowledge is useless, math skills are critical - Pay more<br>
attention in lab - Do something different to your cohort: - Chase down<br>
some open-ended research project - Build something with an Arduino -<br>
Contribute to an Open-Source Software project - Finally, try your best<br>
to socialize with people outside of your department, make sure you get<br>
used to explaining your work and understanding the work of others.</p>
