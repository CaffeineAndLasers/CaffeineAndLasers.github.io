<h2>...They just aren't talking to us</h2>
<p>I read a paper exploring a novel explanation for why the universe is so<br>
darn quiet.</p>
<p>For those unacquainted, the <a href="https://www.space.com/25325-fermi-paradox.html">Fermi<br>
Paradox</a> is the simple<br>
question. &quot;Why is the universe so quiet???&quot;. This follows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation">Drake<br>
Equation</a> which is a kind<br>
of napkin math estimate of how many aliens there are in the universe.<br>
You simply take the number of stars in the universe, multiplied by the<br>
percentage of those stars with planets, multiplied by the percentage of<br>
planets in the habitable zone, multiplied by the probability of life<br>
spontaneously developing. While we don't know the true value of any of<br>
these numbers, even a conservative estimate for each says there should<br>
be plenty of aliens out there for us to find. Simply because the<br>
universe is so big, and there are so many stars!</p>
<p>There are many explanations for the Fermi Paradox. Most of them make<br>
great premises for Sci-Fi works. From the great filter hypothesis (seen<br>
in <em>Mass Effect</em>) to the Dark Forest hypothesis (seen in <em>Three Body<br>
Problem</em>), to the Berserker hypothesis (seen in <em>Berserk</em>). A paper that<br>
hit the ArXiv last month has a novel explanation for why we can't hear<br>
any aliens.</p>
<p>In a sentence.</p>
<p><em>They aren't talking to us</em>.</p>
<p>But, why aren't they talking to us? And why can't we overhear them<br>
talking to each other? That is what this paper addresses.</p>
<p>The author of the paper suggests that interstellar civilisations may<br>
prefer to communicate using quantum communication. The reasons for this<br>
are beyond the scope of my blog post, but in short, you can get more<br>
data, faster, and more securely and lets you do a bunch of things that<br>
are impossible in non-quantum communication.</p>
<p>The physics of Quantum Communication puts some hard limits on what we<br>
Earthlings could expect to hear</p>
<p>When we do &quot;classical&quot; communication here on Earth. All that matters is<br>
that the signal is louder than the background noise. Think about<br>
communication like speech, if you cannot hear your interlocutor inside a<br>
noisy restaurant, you will simply ask them to increase their volume, and<br>
you will be able to understand them.</p>
<p>Radio communication on Earth is like a lightbulb in a dark room. It<br>
sends signals in all directions, and if someone can't hear the message<br>
clearly, we just use a stronger &quot;bulb&quot;. This works because we only need<br>
the signal to be louder than the background noise to understand it.</p>
<p>Quantum communication is different. Quantum communication leverages the<br>
particle-like properties of light (or other quantum things). This means<br>
that the limit is no longer that a signal is louder than the background,<br>
but that a large enough percentage of the individual particles that are<br>
sent get received. The consequence of this is that you cannot just &quot;turn<br>
up the volume&quot; if the receiver isn't getting the signal.</p>
<p>This is less like speaking in a restaurant, and more like a game of<br>
catch. If your ball partner is only catching 50% of the balls you throw,<br>
simply throwing more (turning up the volume) won't help improve their<br>
catch rate. Instead, you need to move closer and throw more accurately.</p>
<p>For effective quantum communication, the MAJORITY of the signal<br>
transmitted must be received to work. As a result, quantum communication<br>
requires small wavelengths. These signals would be transmitted by a<br>
telescope on one end, and received by another telescope on the other.<br>
These laser beams of signal can then be passed through space with high<br>
accuracy, allowing most of the signal to land on target.</p>
<p><img src="ClassicalComsvsQComms.svg" alt="Classical Coms Vs Quantm Comms"></p>
<p>This means that if all the aliens out there are communicating using<br>
Quantum communications:</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>.  They must have <strong>extremely</strong> narrow beams. So it is near impossible<br>
for any stray signal to hit us. Remember, the majority of the signal<br>
needs to hit the receiver, and any that hits us isn't hitting the<br>
receiver.</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>.  They must have <strong>MASSIVE</strong> telescopes to suck up all those photons.<br>
And by massive, I don't mean hundreds of meters wide, or even a<br>
kilometre wide. In order to send a quantum signal between us and our<br>
closest neighbour, quantum information theory predicts you would<br>
need a telescope 100 km wide!</p>
<p>The craziest thing about this explanation is that even if aliens wanted<br>
to talk to us, AND had the technology to do so, they would also have the<br>
technology to see that we wouldn't be able to hear them because we do<br>
not have any large enough telescopes.</p>
<p>So quite simply, it is so quiet, because the aliens are not talking to<br>
us.</p>
