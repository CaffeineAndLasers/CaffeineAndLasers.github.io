<h1>Four Coffee Observations in Two Studies</h1>
<p>There is something beautiful about scientists being given the freedom to<br>
apply their skills to passion projects. High-impact science is valuable,<br>
but the purity of studying a hobby out of sheer interest is something I<br>
will always appreciate.</p>
<p>Here are four observations from two scientific papers on the practice of<br>
coffee grinding. Experienced coffee nerds might know some of these<br>
intuitively, but now we have graphs to back them up.</p>
<h2>1. Study One: Chemical strategies to mitigate electrostatic charging during coffee grinding</h2>
<p>One interesting aspect of coffee grinding is the role of electrostatic<br>
charges. When you grind coffee, the particles become charged, causing<br>
them to clump together and stick to the sides of the grinder. This can<br>
be annoying, as it creates a mess on your coffee station, but it can<br>
also significantly impact the quality of the coffee.</p>
<p>When coffee grounds clump together, water can't flow through them evenly<br>
during brewing. This uneven extraction leads to what's known as<br>
&quot;channeling,&quot; where water finds the path of least resistance and flows<br>
through only part of the coffee bed. The result is a cup of coffee<br>
that's less flavorful and more bitter than it should be. This paper<br>
quantifies two strategies used to minimize this effect.</p>
<h3>1.1 Electrical De-ionizers</h3>
<p>Many modern &quot;luxury&quot; grinders include high-voltage ionizers fitted on<br>
the exit chute of the grinder. The idea behind this device is to bombard<br>
the coffee grinds with charged particles, which neutralize any static<br>
charge picked up during the grinding process.</p>
<p><img src="CoffeeGrindsPaper1Fig3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The graphs shown in <em>d</em> and <em>b</em> demonstrate that fitting an electrical<br>
de-ionizer does indeed reduce the charge buildup on the coffee grinds.</p>
<p>But this isn't the end of the story. Does this reduction in static<br>
charge translate into a better cup of coffee? Observing the bottom<br>
graphs in Figure 5 shows almost no difference between espresso prepared<br>
with and without the de-ionizer. The researchers note that the flavor<br>
difference is negligible as well.</p>
<p>How do we understand this result? The reason seems to be that by the<br>
time the de-ionizer does its job, the damage has already been done---the<br>
coffee grounds have already clumped together.</p>
<p>So while a de-ionizer might make your coffee station less messy, it's<br>
not going to make your coffee taste better.</p>
<p>This raises an interesting question: Could combining a de-ionizer with a<br>
grind distribution tool improve the situation? While de-ionizing the<br>
coffee grinds does not cause the clumps to dissipate on their own,<br>
perhaps it can make them easier to break apart with a coffee<br>
distribution tool?</p>
<h3>1.2 Spritzing the beans with water.</h3>
<p>Another method for reducing static is much simpler: just spritz your<br>
coffee beans with a little water before grinding. The idea is that the<br>
water will dissipate charge as soon as it builds up. This method is much<br>
lower-tech than the solution described above, but how does it compare?</p>
<p>The researchers measured a reduction in static charge when a small<br>
amount of water was added to the coffee before grinding. It also<br>
resulted in lower retention (i.e., how much coffee gets stuck in the<br>
grinder) and reduces the grind coarseness, and increases grind<br>
uniformity.</p>
<p><img src="CoffeeGrindsPaper1Fig4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So how does this affect taste? The study observed that the addition of<br>
water leads to a slower flow rate during brewing, which results in a<br>
more concentrated extraction---especially with darker roasts. This is<br>
also illustrated in figure 5.</p>
<p><img src="CoffeeGrindsPaper1Fig5.png" alt=""></p>
<h3>1.3 Lessons from this paper</h3>
<ul>
<li>Grinders fitted with an electrical de-ionizer do not produce better<br>
coffee but do result in less mess when making coffee.\</li>
<li>Treating beans with a spray of water reduces clumping, resulting in<br>
increased extraction and lower grinder retention.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Study Two: The effect of bean origin and temperature on grinding roasted coffee</h2>
<p>The second study focused on how different factors related to the coffee<br>
beans themselves affect grinding</p>
<p>This paper compares the effects of both bean origin and bean temperature<br>
prior to grinding.</p>
<h3>2.1 The Effect of Bean Origin</h3>
<p>Will different single-origin coffees grind differently? For once, the<br>
answer is simple: NO!</p>
<p><img src="CoffeeGrindsPaper2Fig3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It appears that between different coffees, the grind distribution<br>
produced by the EK43 commercial are near identical for all of them.</p>
<ol>
<li>Four speciality grade coffees were ground to study grind profile<br>
variations.</li>
<li>Grind profiles showed a skewed-Gaussian shape with particle sizes<br>
ranging from 0.1 μm to 1000 μm.</li>
<li>All coffees had similar grind distributions, with minor differences<br>
in number modes and fine particulates cutoff.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a couple things to note here: - All 4 coffees tested were<br>
light/medium roast - This test was only done on an EK43 grinder</p>
<p>There are a couple of things to note here:\</p>
<ul>
<li>All four coffees tested were light/medium roast.\</li>
<li>This test was only done on an EK43 grinder.</li>
</ul>
<p>This raises a few questions about the generalization of the study:\</p>
<ol>
<li>Do darker roasts have the same particle size distribution as light<br>
roasts?\</li>
<li>If not:\</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Are they self-consistent, like the lighter ones are?\</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>The EK43 is an expensive commercial grinder. How consistent are<br>
cheaper home grinders?</li>
</ol>
<h3>2.2 Effect of Bean Temperature</h3>
<p>If you've ever ordered one of those expensive coffees---like the ones<br>
that cost more than $10 a cup---you may have seen the barista pull the<br>
coffee out of a freezer. The reason for this is obvious: they want to<br>
keep the good stuff fresh for as long as possible. These baristas tend<br>
to develop an intuition that freezing the beans makes them &quot;shatter&quot;<br>
more evenly. So how accurate is their intuition?</p>
<p>It turns out it's quite accurate!</p>
<p><img src="CoffeeGrindsPaper2Fig4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The paper's analysis shows that decreasing the temperature of the beans,<br>
all the way down to -196°C, decreases both the average size of each<br>
particle and reduces the &quot;spread&quot; of coffee grind sizes.</p>
<p>The intuition of shattering beans turns out to be an accurate<br>
description of what is happening here. While there are (almost) no ice<br>
crystals within the bean to shatter, the bean itself has a crystalline<br>
structure sensitive to temperature. So chilling the beans really does<br>
cause them to shatter when you hit them.</p>
<p>However, there are some caveats. As the beans pass through the grinder,<br>
they warm up due to friction and contact with hot grinder blades. This<br>
causes diminishing returns both as the coffee gets colder and as the<br>
grinder is set finer.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this effect seems to be reversible. Coffee that's cooled<br>
to extremely low temperatures and then warmed back up to room<br>
temperature behaves just like coffee that was never cooled in the first<br>
place.</p>
<h1>3. So what did we learn?</h1>
<p>The actionable takeaways from this mini deep dive are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Adding water to your coffee pre-grind improves extraction, reduces<br>
retention, and slightly decreases coarseness.\</li>
<li>Freezing coffee increases grind size uniformity.\</li>
<li>The electrical de-ionizer on expensive grinders helps reduce mess<br>
but does not appear to improve your coffee's quality (although<br>
combining de-ionization with distribution tools has not been<br>
studied).\</li>
<li>Different coffees will have similar grind profiles on the same<br>
grinder with identical settings.</li>
