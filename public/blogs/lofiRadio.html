  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> </p>

<h1>1 Announcing My LoFi Terminal Radio</h1>
<p>This was a short weekend project I threw together to replace the<br>
perpetually open YouTube Tab for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfKfPfyJRdk">lofi beats to relax/study<br>
to</a>. The result? A<br>
minimalist audio player that does its job without any frills. Here's<br>
why I created it and how it works.</p>
<h1>2 What is it</h1>
<p>In short, it is an audio player with a very specific emphasis on<br>
being: - minimalist - distraction-free You cannot select tracks, replay<br>
tracks or go to the next track. This is a feature, not a shortcoming. If<br>
you want different music, change the station.</p>
<p>The aim of this is to provide an experience akin to radio. You can turn<br>
it on, change the volume and switch the channel, but the programming is<br>
up to the DJ.</p>
<h1>3 Why Design it like this</h1>
<p>This program isn't to replace your spotify or main music player.<br>
Instead it is to replace your <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfKfPfyJRdk">lofi beats to relax/study<br>
to</a> Youtube tab that stays<br>
open while you work. The channel has 15k streamers on it when I checked,<br>
and has streaming uninterrupted since July 2022.</p>
<p>Why does this exist? Much like some art makes you think, and some exists<br>
just to decorate space. Some music exists to make you think, and some<br>
exist to decorate time. When you get these two types confused your<br>
&quot;background music&quot; can become the focus, distracting you from the work<br>
you are meant to be doing. These &quot;lofi hip-hop&quot; streams exist to play<br>
background music and remove the temptation of fiddling with the<br>
playlist.</p>
<p>The problem is, a 1080p video stream running in a web browser is<br>
super-overkill for listening to music. It wastes network bandwidth,<br>
computer memory, and CPU cycles. On top of this, it removes the<br>
distraction of fiddling with playlists but replaces it with the visual<br>
clutter of an unnecessary browser tab next to your actual work</p>
<h1>4 My Solution</h1>
<p>A tool to replace this should have 1. No way to select tracks or<br>
configure playlists from the UI 2. Stay out of the way when you aren't<br>
using it</p>
<p>For this, I settled on a discrete terminal app that I can stash neatly<br>
out of the way. Especially when I leave it running in my <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/6307/quake-terminal/">Quake<br>
Terminal</a><br>
extension for GNOME.</p>
<p><img src="lofiRadio.png" alt="Screenshot of the UI"></p>
<h1>5 Where Do I install it?</h1>
<p>Install instructions at <a href="https://github.com/CJones-Optics/lofi-player">My<br>
Repo</a></p>
<h1>6 Customising it</h1>
<h2>6.1 Colours!</h2>
<p>The UI is determined by css, with the colours defined at the top of the<br>
file. Change your colour scheme to whatever you want just by changing<br>
the hex codes at the top of the css file.</p>
<h2>6.2 Keybindings!</h2>
<p>Don't like vim? Iwon't hold it against you. There is a simple text<br>
file of the keybindings. Change the key to whatever you need.</p>
<h1>7 Does it work on:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Linux
<ul>
<li><strong>Yes!</strong> I have tested it on two machines and a virtual machine</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mac
<ul>
<li><strong>Probably!</strong> I haven't tested. Try it and let me know. I<br>
can't afford a Macbook.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Windows
<ul>
<li><strong>Eventually!</strong> There are some bugs specific to Window's<br>
implementation of Python. (Or maybe Linux's implementation?)<br>
Either way, it doesn't work as perfectly on Windows. It will be<br>
fixed when I get around to it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>8 This is all well and good, but who has MP3 files anymore?</h1>
<p>You got me there! Spotify support isn't really something I can be<br>
bothered messing with. Instead, I built my playlists from the Royalty<br>
Free resources available at<br>
<a href="https://pixabay.com/music/search/lofi/">Pixbay</a>, but for artists, you<br>
are genuinely fond of you can actually support them by buying their<br>
music through Bandcamp.</p>
<h1>9 Technical Details</h1>
<h2>9.1 Frameworks</h2>
<ul>
<li>Both the backend and UI are written in Python
<ul>
<li>Backend uses PyGame to handle the mp3 playback</li>
<li>Frontend uses the Textual Framework to handle keybindings, and<br>
tcss for a css-like experience configuring the UI</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>9.2 How it works:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The player process grabs a directory of mp3 files, and a playlist<br>
object grabs each file one at a time, and throws it at the player<br>
object when it needs a new song.</li>
<li>A queue is used to pass commands from the UI in <a href="http://TUI.py">TUI.py</a>, to the<br>
process in <a href="http://musicPlayer.py">musicPlayer.py</a> and messages back in the other direction.</li>
</ul>
<h2>9.3 Customisability</h2>
<p>At the moment the application is optimised for my specific use case. And<br>
I am very opinionated. This means: -The entire program is controlled<br>
from the keyboard, with vim keybindings - No &quot;Next&quot; button is exposed<br>
in the UI.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the frameworks used are very flexible, allowing for easy<br>
hackability. To change the colours of the UI, you only need to change<br>
the hexcodes in <code>style.tcss</code>. To add mouse support, you can easily<br>
implement buttons using Textualise's built-in widgets. In fact, the<br>
repo has a spare folder for GUI elements I designed, (then removed) to<br>
get you started.</p>
<p>The process also already has a command written for the next track. You<br>
only need to add the UI element if you really want it.</p>
<h1>10 Future Changes</h1>
<p>Future changes are unlikely because it currently fits my use case.<br>
However for the sake of completeness, here is how I may extend the<br>
application. - Custom theming. - At the moment I have a Catpuccino theme<br>
hardcoded into it. An implementation to vary the colour scheme would be<br>
simple to implement and highly beneficial - Implement GUI and Mouse<br>
Support. - I have a soft spot for text-only UIs, which is why it is<br>
implemented like this. The framework does support buttons for mouse UIs<br>
though. The app does work with buttons but I thought they were ugly and<br>
removed them. Check the commit history for implementation -Old School<br>
animated music visualiser: - This is somewhat antithetical to the design<br>
philosophy, but they are a lot of fun. I plan on building one<br>
eventually.\</p>
<ul>
<li>GUI Support Cont: Implement a list feature for all the stations.</li>
</ul>
<h1>11 Conclusion</h1>
<p>The LoFi Terminal Radio aims to provide a distraction-free,<br>
resource-efficient alternative to streaming background music. If you're<br>
looking for a minimalist approach to your work soundtrack, give it a<br>
try! Feedback and contributions are always welcome.</p>
