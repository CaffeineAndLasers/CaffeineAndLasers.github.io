<h1>1 Anatomy of the Espresso</h1>
<p>There are dozens of methods of brewing coffee, from the humble filter,<br>
plunger, aeropress and cold brew. But here in Australia, when we hear<br>
&quot;coffee&quot;, we think espresso. There is a lot of mysticism around coffee<br>
culture and the espresso, so as a coffee enthusiast and a nerd, I figure<br>
it is my responsibility to help out.</p>
<p>There are two factors which set Espresso apart from other methods of<br>
coffee brewing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Constant water flow</li>
<li>High-Pressure extraction.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's explore what these two things mean for our coffee below.</p>
<h2>1.1 Flow</h2>
<p>Unlike immersion methods like the plunger, where the coffee is immersed<br>
in a fixed batch of hot water, espresso cycles fresh water through the<br>
coffee at a constant rate. This results in more efficient extraction.<br>
Imagine trying to dissolve your milo, the more milo is already in<br>
solution the harder it is to dissolve any more. So by cycling fresh<br>
water through the coffee grinds, we make it easier for that water to<br>
dissolve the flavour compounds in the water.</p>
<p><img src="/blogs/FlowVsImmersion.svg" alt="Diagramm of the difference between Flow and Immersion"></p>
<h2>1.2 Pressure</h2>
<p>While plenty of other methods use flow (e.g. filter coffee), Espresso<br>
stands alone in using high pressure to maximise extraction. Using high<br>
pressure extraction further maximises the ability of the water to<br>
dissolve the flavour compounds.</p>
<p>The combination of these two factors is what allows the incredibly rich<br>
and concentrated nature of the espresso, and it is these factors we keep<br>
in mind when exploring how espresso works.</p>
<h1>2 Flavour</h1>
<h2>2.1 Taste and Aromatics</h2>
<p>Like many natural products (e.g. beer and wine) it is important to<br>
consider taste and flavour differently. Taste is the 5 basic tastes,<br>
sweet, salt, acid, umami, and bitter. While flavour is the complex<br>
interaction between taste, aroma and texture. Think of it like the<br>
difference between citric acid and a juicy lemon.</p>
<h3>2.1.1 Taste</h3>
<p>The primary taste profile of Espresso is salt and a balance of sour and<br>
bitter, with just a small amount of sweetness. Taste in an Espresso is<br>
optimised by balancing its extraction while maximising its strength.</p>
<h3>2.1.2 Aromatics</h3>
<p>Aromatics are the parts of the flavour that aren't the sense of taste,<br>
or texture. When a coffee says it tastes like stone fruit they are<br>
talking about the Aromatics.</p>
<p>Aromatics are experienced through our sense of smell. The pharynx is the<br>
tube that connects our mouth to our nose. It is what got filled up that<br>
time you laughed so hard that spaghetti came out of your nose, but it is<br>
also what lets us experience the smell of food while we are eating.</p>
<p>In coffee, the compounds responsible for aromatic expression are Esters,<br>
alcohols and Phenols. These highly volatile compounds freely evaporate<br>
allowing us to smell them, but are also very sensitive to changes in<br>
their environment.</p>
<h2>2.2 Extraction and Strength</h2>
<p>The difference between a good espresso and a bad espresso is the balance<br>
of its extraction and its strength.</p>
<p><img src="/blogs/CoffeeDiagram.svg" alt="Description of SVG image"></p>
<h3>2.2.1 Extraction</h3>
<p>During an espresso's extraction, the flavour profile is not even<br>
throughout the shot. The most soluble products are extracted first,<br>
while the less soluble are extracted after.</p>
<p>Typically the early fraction is acidic, tasting sour, brightly coloured,<br>
a warm honeycomb, and carries the oils and oil soluble Aromatics.</p>
<p>The later fractions are the near inverse. They are alkaline, tasting<br>
bitter, very darkly coloured like dark chocolate, and carries out the<br>
water soluble salts and aromatics.</p>
<p>An &quot;over-extracted&quot; espresso is characterised by a burnt and ashy taste.<br>
When people complain that their coffee is &quot;burned&quot; it is normally<br>
over-extracted.</p>
<p>Therefore, a &quot;balanced&quot; espresso is one which balances the bitter<br>
alkaline with the sour acid to reach a point where they approximately<br>
cancels out and is not too bitter or sour.</p>
<h3>2.2.2 Strength</h3>
<p>While a balanced espresso is one where the right amount of soluble<br>
compounds are dissolved, a strong espresso is one which achieves this in<br>
as little water as possible (or more accurately, maximises the<br>
concentration of flavour per mL)</p>
<p>A strong Espresso is more viscous than water, owing to the significant<br>
fraction of oils suspended in the solution. This gives an Espresso its<br>
texture (or as the weirdos call it &quot;Mouthfeel&quot;)</p>
<h1>3 Parameters Baristas Measure and Control</h1>
<p>An espresso &quot;recipe&quot; is three numbers: 1. Dose 2. Yield 3. Time. When a<br>
barista wants to replicate the taste of espresso days apart, they<br>
attempt to replicate these numbers.</p>
<h3>3.1.1 Dose</h3>
<p>Dose is quite simply the amount of coffee which goes into the basket<br>
before you extract.</p>
<p>Increasing the dose does two things. 1. Increase the strength 2.<br>
Increase the resistance to flow, increasing extraction</p>
<p>Point 1 is quite simple to understand, the higher the dose-to-yield<br>
ratio, the more concentrated the Espresso will be. Point number 2 is a<br>
little more complicated though. By adding more coffee to the basket, it<br>
increases the resistance to the pressure applied by the machine,<br>
resulting in a longer extraction time. Read on to see how this affects<br>
things.</p>
<h3>3.1.2 Yield</h3>
<p>While dose is how much coffee grind you put in, yield is how much<br>
Espresso we pull out. Increasing the yield will change the coffee by. 1.<br>
Increasing the extraction 2. Decreasing the strength</p>
<p>Since dissolving things into solution, is a chemical equilibrium<br>
process, sometimes the barista might add extra water to squeeze out that<br>
last bit of flavour.</p>
<h3>3.1.3 Time</h3>
<p>The time is quite simply how long it takes to pull the shot. This final<br>
variable is where the art of espresso is revealed. Because while the<br>
barista controls the dose and yield, they do not have any control over<br>
how long the espresso takes to extract. This is something they can only<br>
measure.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, for a fixed dose and yield, an increased time will<br>
result in higher extraction, since the water stays in contact with the<br>
coffee grinds for longer.</p>
<p>The time it takes to extract a shot is driven by the machine pressure<br>
and the coffee's resistance. Since the pressure is not something the<br>
barista changes during service, this leaves resistance as the variable.</p>
<p>Coffee's resistance itself varies with a number of factors including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grinder Settings</li>
<li>Grind Dose</li>
<li>Environmental Temperature</li>
<li>Humidity</li>
<li>Grinder Condition</li>
<li>Coffee's Age</li>
<li>Basket Geometry</li>
<li>And More!</li>
</ul>
<p>Of all the factors that affect resistance, the only ones under the<br>
barista's control are dose and coarseness. Since the other factors<br>
change over the course of the day, so will the coarseness have to change<br>
to account for these differences.</p>
<h1>4 Dialing in the espresso</h1>
<p>The process of making an espresso taste good, is the process of<br>
exploring the parameter space in order balance extraction and maximise<br>
strength, by adjusting dose, yield and grinder settings. .</p>
<h1>5 Conclusion</h1>
<p>And that's it! That is all the information you need to know to<br>
understand what the hell those weird coffee nerds are talking about, or<br>
maybe level up your own coffee :)</p>
