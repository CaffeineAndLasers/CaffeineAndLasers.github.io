 <h1 style="font-size:35px;">On Personal Style And Rolemodels</h1>

<div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2025-05-27</p>

<p>While &quot;Fashion&quot; has never been a hobby of mine, for most of my life I have prided myself on having something  of a &quot;bold&quot; personal style, preferring big colourful and interesting shaped outfits over the boring and overdonie fashion trends of my time and culture. T-Shirt, jeans and expensive sneakers just never seemed all that interesting to me.</p>
<p>That said, I have noticed my personal style has changed over the past two or three years. Slowly at first, I didn't even realise it was changing, let alone thought of it as a conscious choice. I started wearing more loose fitting clothes, ditched some of the wild bright colours for slightly more muted colours (But still colourful, don't worry), and started wearing oversize, floral short sleeve T-Shirts more often. I stared letting my hair grow out longer, and no longer maintained a clean shave.</p>
<p>And to perfectly illustrate my point, here is me wearing the same reversible jacket, six years apart.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-around; align-items: center; gap: 20px; flex-wrap: wrap;">
<div style="text-align: center; flex: 1; min-width: 300px;">

<p>After a while I just decided that this was just the transition between being an early twenty-something year old, and a late twenty-something year old.</p>
<p>But then I thought about it</p>
<p>And then I overthought it.</p>
<p>And I think I figured out why.</p>
<p>To some degree or another, everyone attempts to emulate those they respect. That is what it means to have a role model. Its also how social groups idenitfy and cliques form and evolve. You can spot a the difference between a metalhead and a pop-fanatic thanks to their different uniforms.</p>
<p>So, what I <strong>actually</strong> witnessed, was my personal values changing, which lead to my role models changing, which lead to my style changing.</p>
<p>When I was in university, I was consuming heaps of transgressive art and seeing heaps of live music and as a result tried to emulate those cool guy artists I admired.
Then eventually the life I was chasing down for myself started to change. Like I think a lot of people going through their mid-twenties the desire to
&quot;do something big&quot; and &quot;change the world&quot; started to cool down  a bit, and was replaced with the desire to live a slightly slower life, and enjoy the ride.
With this, I saw my role models change. Instead of trying to copy the super &quot;successful&quot; people, CEOs, Massive Artists, Nobel Prize winners, I started to
look  towards my collegues who actually seemed content. Overwhelmingly,these are the types of folks who fit all the stereotypes for the slightly dishevelled engineer / scientist. And they always have some mad backyard science project going on as their weekend hobby (I know literal hobbyist rocket engineers, who's day job is in photonics). So, over time, as I started to emulate their behaviour, I also started to copy their styles.</p>
<p>Basically, what I am saying: I got <strong>stembofied:</strong></p>
