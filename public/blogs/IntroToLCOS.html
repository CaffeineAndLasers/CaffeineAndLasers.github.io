 <h1 style="font-size:35px;">An Introduction To LCOS</h1>

<div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2024-08-01</p>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> </p>
</div>

<p>From my time at Finisar I got to work extensively with <strong>L</strong>iquid<br>
<strong>C</strong>rystal <strong>o</strong>n <strong>S</strong>ilicon (LCOS), <strong>S</strong>patial <strong>L</strong>ight<br>
<strong>M</strong>odulators (SLMs). This page is my attempt to share a little of what<br>
I've learned, because it is such a cool technology that I hope others<br>
get to work with.</p>
<h1>1 What is an LCOS SLM?</h1>
<p>There are two acronyms here, so I will break it down into its composite<br>
parts before I piece everything back together.</p>
<h2>1.1 Liquid Crystals</h2>
<p>We all know that liquids are substances without any structure, the<br>
molecules are free to move around, and don't have any structure. A<br>
crystal on the other hand, has a lot of structure, it is a substance<br>
with a structure that repeats in one, two or three dimensions (or four<br>
if you count <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_crystal">time crystals</a><br>
). Bringing the two concepts together, liquid crystals are a substance<br>
with a loosely repeating structure, where molecules are free to jostle,<br>
twist, and rotate, but not break out of their structure.</p>
<p>The molecular structure of the liquid crystals we are interested in<br>
gives it another trick that makes it useful for our applications. If we<br>
consider the MBBA molecule:</p>
<p><img src="LiquidCrystalDiagram.png" alt="Chemical Diagram of the MBBA Molecule"></p>
<p>It has a long rod-like structure, AND a free electron that is able to<br>
move up and down the length of the molecule uninterrupted. This electron<br>
makes the substance both electrically and optically active.</p>
<p>Putting all this together, liquid crystals are long, rod shaped<br>
molecules who arrange themselves in a repeating lattice with both<br>
electrical and optical responses.</p>
<p><img src="LCLattice.png" alt="Lattice of Liquid Crystals"></p>
<h3>1.2.1 Electrical Properties of Liquid Crystals {#electrical-properties}</h3>
<p>As a result of that free electron, when we expose a liquid crystal<br>
lattice to an electric field, the molecules will rotate, re-orienting<br>
themselves to point in the same direction of the electric field. This<br>
means that by applying a voltage, we can control the axis or the<br>
direction of our liquid crystal.</p>
<h3>1.2.2 Optical Properties of Liquid Crystals {#optical-properties}</h3>
<p>That free electron also affects the optical properties of the light.<br>
This is because light is an electro-magnetic field, so the free electron<br>
will oscillate in harmony with the electric field of any light that<br>
passes through it, this slows down the speed of light through the<br>
substance. There is a catch though, that electron can only run up and<br>
down the length of the molecule, so if the molecule is not totally in<br>
the same axis as the electric field of the light, the effect will be<br>
reduced. That means that the refractive index of the substance (the<br>
speed which light moves through it), is determined by the the angle the<br>
light hits the crystal at.</p>
<p>This is important, because slowing down light is how we bend it. Imagine<br>
when you are driving a car, and your left tyre is slowed by a puddle,<br>
making you veer left. When light hits a slow patch at an angle it bends.<br>
This is how lenses (like the ones in your glasses works.)</p>
<h2>1.2 Silicon</h2>
<p>Now that we have gotten liquid crystals out of the way, lets talk about<br>
silicon technology. Undoubtedly computers have changed the world, but<br>
convenient side effect for us that work in optics, is that the computer<br>
revolution has resulted in cheap, high quality semiconductor<br>
manufacturing. So any time we can exploit silicon technology for optics,<br>
we jump on the opportunity.</p>
<p>In order to control those liquid crystals I described above, we sandwich<br>
the liquid crystal between a silicon chip and a conductive transparent<br>
top glass. The silicon chip lets us apply a custom voltage anywhere in<br>
the x-y plane. That is, we can create an arbitrary electric field<br>
pattern across the liquid crystal.</p>
<h1>2 Putting it all together {#putting-together-the-first-word}</h1>
<p>After all that, we are ready to understand what the device does. An LCoS<br>
is a device that allows you to apply any refractive index profile you<br>
want in an x-y plane. It does this by creating an arbitrary electric<br>
field profile using silicon chip technology, and placing liquid crystals<br>
within that field, whose refractive index is a function electric field<br>
strength. This contraption allows you modulate the phase of incoming<br>
light in space. This is why we call them a <strong>Spatial Light Modulator</strong>.</p>
<p>In simple English. This is a lens, that we can reshape into any optical<br>
configuration from a computer.</p>
<h1>3 Applications</h1>
<p>There are a surprising number of applications for LCOS SLMs, from Beam<br>
Steering, to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.2078">photographing through walls and around<br>
corners</a>, but I want to talk about<br>
digital holography for now.</p>
<h2>3.1 Digital Holography</h2>
<p>Using spatial light phase modulation, we can use an SLM to create a real<br>
life holograms. The required necessary phase map to create a given<br>
hologram's amplitude map can be calculated using the Gerchburg Saxton<br>
Algorithm.</p>
<p>This algorithm creates a phase profile, which when light propagates<br>
through, creates constructive interference at the desired points in 3D<br>
space, and deconstructively interferes everywhere else.</p>
<p>Below you can see a hologram I built in the lab. The photo fails to do<br>
it justice. If I were to move the box forward or backwards, the hologram<br>
would disappear, since it was programmed to appear at that specific<br>
point in space. It would have worked better if I had a smoke machine on<br>
hand.</p>

box"></p>
<h3>3.1.1 Holographic Optical Tweezers</h3>
<p>Aside from cool sci-fi implications of real life holograms replacing<br>
zoom calls, I would like to highlight one especially cool application of<br>
Computer Generated Holograms and LCOS SLMs, and that is Optical<br>
Tweezers. This effect relies on the fact that light has momentum. By<br>
exploiting this fact, we can use CGH to create a donut shaped light<br>
intensity profile, and use the momentum contained within this profile to<br>
pick up and move around small objects. This is super useful for things<br>
like neuron cells, which tend to respond poorly to being picked up by<br>
glass pipettes. Holographic Optical Tweezers offer a comparatively<br>
gentle experience for the cells. This concept is used with some<br>
regularity within biological research and is a commercial product<br>
offered by <a href="https://www.meadowlark.com/3d-holographic-optical-tweezing-kit/">Meadowlark Polarisation<br>
Optics</a>.<br>
You can see a demonstration below, where particles only 4.5 micrometers<br>
are being manipluated by such a device. <img src="HolographicOpticalTweezers.png" alt="A microscope photograph of
microparticels aranged as numbers

<h2>3.2 Spy Stuff</h2>
<p>It turn out, the only difference between white paint and a mirror, is<br>
that white paint isn't very smooth. It reflects all the colours the<br>
same as a mirror, but scatters the light - reflecting it at different<br>
angles and distances.</p>
<p>This is where the LCOS comes in again, if the light has been scattered<br>
by the white paint, we can use an LCOS to undo that distortion, and<br>
reconstruct an image. This is what <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.2078">these<br>
researchers</a> figured out, where they<br>
were able to take photos around corners by photographing white paint,<br>
and through &quot;privacy&quot; glass. <img src="lookingAroundCorners.png" alt="extract of a scientific paper, showing

<h1>4 Conclusion</h1>
<p>I hope you enjoyed this short introduction to my niche area of interest.<br>
There are plenty of cool applications for LCoS in the world of research<br>
and engineering, and if you ever get the chance to work with the, I<br>
would highly recommend it.</p>
