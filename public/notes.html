<p><strong>This is where I put all my notes</strong>
These are bits and pieces which are either too short, or not original
enough to be a blog post. In here you will find links to other bits of the web I find
interesting, random thoughts and pictures I might want to share.</p>

<p>If you want to keep track, my notes are in a separate <a href="/feeds/notes.xml">RSS feed</a>.</p>

        <!-- Now embed everything from the file -->
        <h1>Podcast is the best medium for horror fiction</h1>
<p>If you ever watch horror movies, you know that the anticipation is scarier than the reveal. The scraping noise against the window beats the monster reveal on the terror factor every time. This is the mistake that bad horror movies make when they reveal their monster too early.</p>
<p>The reason for this is simple. Your imagination will create a monster far more terrifying than the best CGI in the world.</p>
<p>So what if it’s all in your imagination? I truly believe that podcast is the best medium for horror fiction today. There are some extremely talented story writers partnering with equally talented audio mixers to create stories that suck you in and keep you terrified.</p>
<p>The best of these stories embrace the limitations of the medium. They are based around listening to the radio chatter during a crisis, or found audio recordings after the attack’s aftermath.</p>
<p>My favourite horror and thriller podcasts at the moment are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://thewhitevault.com/">The White Vault</a> – Very heavily inspired by <em>The Thing</em>, it follows an Arctic expedition that takes a bad turn. It does a really good job at putting the characters in “no-win” scenarios which force them to make terrifying decisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.derelictpodcast.com/">Fathom and its sequel Derelict</a> – This is the one that got me really into the medium. The audio production is phenomenal. Season 1 is set deep in an undersea base, the sound design—creaking metal, distant water rushing through cracks—builds an auditory environment so immersive, it’s crazy.</p>

</ul>

        <p>Whoops, thought I fixed my RSS feeds <a href="https://caffeineandlasers.com/notes/20250417_AddingExtraFeeds.html">last week</a>, Turns out I just broke it again in a new way. This time, they should be working. I think.</p>

        <!-- Now embed everything from the file -->
        <p>Quiet few months. Turns out my RSS feed was broken. Sorry for the spam of todays three posts.</p>
<p>Two Important Updates:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I fixed the RSS functionality of my site. If you missed anything from this year, feel free to go back and read my older articles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I added multiple feeds to my site. This one (the one you are probably subscribed to if you are reading this in your RSS reader), combines my blogposts, and shorter notes and links. If you are interested in subscribing to JUST my longform blogs, you can grab that link from my page. (Ditto for just my notes).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks!</p>

        <!-- Now embed everything from the file -->
        <p>Its kind of wild that Quantum tech has gotten to the point where folks are sharing Open Source schematics for N-V Quantum Magnetomer's with a total BOM of &gt;$250AUD. The construction seems (relatively) accessible as well.</p>
<p>Read about it on their <a href="https://quantumvillage.org/">Site</a> and their <a href="https://github.com/QuantumVillage/UncutGem">github repo</a>.</p>
<p>According to some of the authors on LinkedIn V2 may be sold as a kit to hobbyists.</p>
