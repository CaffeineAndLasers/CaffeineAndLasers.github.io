        <!-- Now embed everything from the file -->
        <p>Shoutout to <a href="https://heals-draws.art/">Heals</a> for sharing their own workflow in a Mastodon post for inspiring me.</p>
<h1>Problem Statement</h1>
<p>Here are two axioms, which were until recently, incompatible.</p>
<ol>
<li>I want all my notes to be digitized in plain text</li>
<li>I enjoy writing in pen and paper</li>
</ol>
<p>Keeping everything in plain text preserves my writing well into the future and hopefully as long as I am alive. But writing on pen and paper <em>feels nice</em>. It is more ergonomic, more tactile, and I genuinely believe it helps me recall what I have written better.</p>
<h1>What Do?</h1>
<p>It turns out LLM Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is getting <strong>really good</strong>. (I hate the acronym OCR, there is nothing optical about it, but that is a topic for another blogpost).</p>
<p>So with Heals advice I settled on <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-ocr">Mistral's OCR</a>. They have a generous enough free tier, and seems to perform really well.</p>
<p>So, since the folks at Mistral have already done all the hard work, I wrote a wrapper for my workflow.</p>
<h1>How does it work?</h1>
<p>I have a bash script which watches a directory on my computer. Now when I finish writing a page a take a photo of my notes, and drop it in the this directory.</p>
<p>When a new photo is detected, the script sends it to Mistral to extract all the text, and any doodles I might've done on the page. It then compiles a markdown version of my notes, and saves it into my Obsidian vault.</p>
<h1>Does it Work?</h1>
<p>Here is a sample of my text and the output.</p>
<div style="display: flex; gap: 1em; align-items: flex-start;">
    <img src="/Assets/634b047a1182d9c022be4c46facf6145.png" style="height: 300px; object-fit: contain;" alt="Sample 1"/>
    <img src="/Assets/cb6e6a037c8feeb39a27d940a9be80fd.png" style="height: 300px; object-fit: contain;" alt="Sample 2"/>
</div>
<p>My handwriting is normally pretty messy, most &quot;handwriting recognition&quot; software normally fails on my writting but it succeeds most of the time here. The most common failure mode I encounter is in complicated mathematics expressions, or the characters I know that that I write weirdly sometimes. (e.g. <code>\varepsilon</code>)</p>
<p>I've been used it on realy samples of my handwriting a few times over the coarse of 2 weeks now before I posted this, so I am confident that the tool actually works on things other than just the sample pages above.</p>

        <p><em>The following is a paraphrased exerpt from Mark Rowland's book &quot;The Happiness of Dogs&quot;. I haven't finished it yet, but even from chapter one I would reccomend it.</em></p>
<p>Okay, so according to Camus, in order to understand life's meaning we must: &quot;imagine Sisyphus Happy&quot;. Most reasonable people will respond, &quot;but how&quot; after all, repetition is the practically the definition of boring</p>
<p>&quot;Well let me tell you about my dog&quot; says Mark Rowlands</p>
<p>Every day I take him for a walk along the canals. And every day he runs along the bank, scaring the local iguanas to the other side of the canal, where they will stay until the next morning, and my dog will repeat the task.
Not only does my dog accept his iguana herding duties with zeal, it seems to be his favorite part of the day</p>

        <!-- Now embed everything from the file -->
        <p>Here is a quick write up for method I threw together for getting my writing out of Obsidian and into my website.</p>
<p>The problem statement:</p>
<p>While Eleventy is capable of turning markdown into html, there are a handful of slight differences between my web environment and my obsidian environment that made things tedious.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I have to manually drag across images</strong>: All of my images are thrown in an <code>Assets</code> folder in Obsidian, and embeded into my docs from there. When I want to get an article into my web directory, I had to manually find and copy and paste the files linked in the markdown one-by-one. Which is annoying</li>
<li><strong>Wikilinks vs Vanilla Md links</strong>. In Obsidian I embed image with the follwing syntax <code>![[Image.jpg]]</code>, however in my Web directory, I need to link to my Assets folder with a regular markdown link like this: <code>![alt text](/Assets/Image.jpg)</code>, and eleventy can't figure out what to do with these wiki links</li>
<li><strong>My Obisidian Front Matter and my Web Front matter are different</strong>. I need to strip out all the metadata from my vault. (Tags, parent notes etc), and add the metadata relevant to my web page.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thankfully thanks to the power of modern computing, this was a task easy to automate.</p>
<h2>Step 1 - Obsidian &quot;Markdown Export&quot; Plugin</h2>
<p><a href="obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-markdown-export-plugin">This plugin</a> is simple. It copies the current note to a new export directory, along with everything else embedded in it. (Including Images).</p>
<h2>Step 2 - Obsidian-Import.js</h2>
<p>Then I &quot;wrote&quot;* a quick bit of Javascript for use in my Node environment. It</p>
<ol>
<li>Grabs the markdown file from the export file</li>
<li>Removes the Obsidian Front Matter</li>
<li>Generates and adds the website front matter</li>
<li>Does a bit of regex to fix the wikilinks and re-link them to the correct location in my website directory</li>
<li>Saves everything where it needs to go.</li>
</ol>
<h1>1 Putting it all together.</h1>
<p>Now all I need to do to get a post out of obsidian and into my website is</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Hit the markdown export plugin in Obsidian</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>Run <code>node obisian-import --blog</code> within my websites directory</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>2.5 Verify it looks right</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li>Commit and push my changes</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This very post was generated with this method.</p>
<p>The code is kind of specific to my website, with a bunch of hard-coded paths. (e.g. I differentiate between notes like this and blogposts), but feel free to take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/CaffeineAndLasers/CaffeineAndLasers.github.io/blob/main/obsidian-import.js">code</a> and make it work for you.</p>
<p>* NOTE: By &quot;I wrote&quot;, I mean I gave a list of requirements to Claude and iterated until it passed my requirements. I am not good at JavaScript</p>

        <!-- Now embed everything from the file -->
        <p>Something I have been dealing with during my PhD, is that it is really hard to describe the 3D geometry of a photonic crystal just using words. Having pictures helps, but doesn't always cut it.</p>
<p>I was mulling over this problem after I was excitedly trying to explain my recent results to friends, family and collegues.... and none of them had any idea what I was talking about... Fair enough.</p>
<p>I saw a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwtwOqdlY5E">video by Dr Fatima</a> a lil while back, where she mentioned a talk she saw where the speaker handed out 3D printed slices of the universe at different point ins time</p>
<p>💡💡💡</p>
<p>So: I 3D printed a scale model of my photonic crysal fiber.</p>
<p><strong>Behlod! A 200:1(ish) representation of a photonic crystal fiber slice</strong></p>
<p><img src="/Assets/3DPrintedPCF.jpg" alt="Blue plastic model of Photonic Crystal Fiber"></p>
<p>This is only a short section, because I wanted to verify that it will actually work.</p>
<p>I bought some translucent PETG so the next version will look kinda like glass (maybe) and I will print a longer section. I will update with a new post once I have this longer version.</p>
<p>In reality these fibers are less than a quarter milimeter in diameter, and made of glass, so a scaled up version is necessary.</p>
<p>Now in future talks and presentations, I will have hands on props to pass around. Hopefully this will help people understand what the device I am describing actually looks like.</p>

        <p>I found this topic from <a href="https://jodiettenberg.substack.com/">Jodie Ettenburg's Curious About Everything Newsletter</a>, and considering the cool physics involved I had to re-share it here. Researchers at Northwestern University have just broke the record for the <a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/03/worlds-smallest-pacemaker-is-activated-by-light/">smallest pacemaker</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/Assets/Pacemakers.png" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p>From left, a traditional pacemake, a leadless pacemaker and the new pacemaker.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are my two favourite bits about it:</p>
<h2>It uses your BODY as the battery!</h2>
<p>Okay, so you know how in high-school you did the experiment wher you shoved a bit of copper and zinc into a lemon, and use that as a battery to power a lightbulb or something? Yeah, in this device, YOU are the lemon.</p>
<p>So typically, the way you power small temporary pacemaker is by using an inductive coil, and keeping the power supply outside your body. This is the same way your phones wireless charger works. The problem is that inductive charging coils are bulky.</p>
<p>The solution was to embed two different metal electrodes on the device, and use your body's fluid as the electrolyte. This battery is what powers the device.</p>
<h2>It uses light to control it!</h2>
<p>If that wasn't cool enough, they had to add cool optics into it as well. There is no compter or anything inside the device, instead it is controlled externally. The device is controlled through a photodiode, and an external heart monitor and infrared LED. When the heartmonitor detects irreglarities in the heartbeat, the LEDs light up, and transmit through the flesh to the device's photodiode control.</p>
<h2>It saves babies!</h2>
<p>The reason the device is designed to be so small, is that it is designed with newborn babies in mind, to help them if they are born with congenital heart defect.</p>
<h2>And it dissolves!</h2>
<p>Since the application is typically only temporary, the device simply dissolves into the body when it is no longer required. That way, you don't need surgery to extract it at the end.</p>

        <p>It's frustrating that nearly every niche interest and hobby's main online community exists on Reddit, because Reddit is fucking terrible for fostering genuine communities.</p>
<p>If you go into any subreddit - I will pick on /r/3DPrinting for now - at least 50% of the posts are either &quot;Look at my very first print&quot; or &quot;Help me debug this issue&quot; (They absolutely did not google it before asking for help on reddit).</p>
<p>While there is nothing <em>inherently</em> wrong with introducing yourself to the community or asking for help, that's not what keeps experienced members engaged in the community. So you have all these newbie posts polluting the online community frustrating people who want to have deeper discussions about the hobby. And it isn't the newbies fault either, newbies need somewhere to share space with experienced people to get that experience.</p>
<p>Is this some unsolvable fact of life about online communities? <strong>NO!</strong></p>
<p>Traditional forums solved this by making separate threads for <em>introductions</em> and <em>help threads</em> and <em>memes / off topic</em>. We didn't just throw everything into one big list and wish you luck.</p>
<p>Anyway, can we go back to forums? I'm so sick of reddit man.</p>

        <h1>Podcast is the best medium for horror fiction</h1>
<p>If you ever watch horror movies, you know that the anticipation is scarier than the reveal. The scraping noise against the window beats the monster reveal on the terror factor every time. This is the mistake that bad horror movies make when they reveal their monster too early.</p>
<p>The reason for this is simple. Your imagination will create a monster far more terrifying than the best CGI in the world.</p>
<p>So what if it’s all in your imagination? I truly believe that podcast is the best medium for horror fiction today. There are some extremely talented story writers partnering with equally talented audio mixers to create stories that suck you in and keep you terrified.</p>
<p>The best of these stories embrace the limitations of the medium. They are based around listening to the radio chatter during a crisis, or found audio recordings after the attack’s aftermath.</p>
<p>My favourite horror and thriller podcasts at the moment are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://thewhitevault.com/">The White Vault</a> – Very heavily inspired by <em>The Thing</em>, it follows an Arctic expedition that takes a bad turn. It does a really good job at putting the characters in “no-win” scenarios which force them to make terrifying decisions.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.derelictpodcast.com/">Fathom and its sequel Derelict</a> – This is the one that got me really into the medium. The audio production is phenomenal. Season 1 is set deep in an undersea base, the sound design—creaking metal, distant water rushing through cracks—builds an auditory environment so immersive, it’s crazy.</p>

        <p>Whoops, thought I fixed my RSS feeds <a href="https://caffeineandlasers.com/notes/20250417_AddingExtraFeeds.html">last week</a>, Turns out I just broke it again in a new way. This time, they should be working. I think.</p>

        <!-- Now embed everything from the file -->
        <p>Quiet few months. Turns out my RSS feed was broken. Sorry for the spam of todays three posts.</p>
<p>Two Important Updates:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I fixed the RSS functionality of my site. If you missed anything from this year, feel free to go back and read my older articles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I added multiple feeds to my site. This one (the one you are probably subscribed to if you are reading this in your RSS reader), combines my blogposts, and shorter notes and links. If you are interested in subscribing to JUST my longform blogs, you can grab that link from my page. (Ditto for just my notes).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks!</p>

        <!-- Now embed everything from the file -->
        <p>Its kind of wild that Quantum tech has gotten to the point where folks are sharing Open Source schematics for N-V Quantum Magnetomer's with a total BOM of &gt;$250AUD. The construction seems (relatively) accessible as well.</p>
<p>Read about it on their <a href="https://quantumvillage.org/">Site</a> and their <a href="https://github.com/QuantumVillage/UncutGem">github repo</a>.</p>
<p>According to some of the authors on LinkedIn V2 may be sold as a kit to hobbyists.</p>

        <p>One of my favourite sites on thie IndieWeb RainbowSpec focuses entirely on learning everything you could possibly want about the optics of rainbows. From the visible spectrum to double rainbows, and glories. Worth a good read!</p>
