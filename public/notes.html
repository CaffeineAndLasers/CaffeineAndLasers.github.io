        <!-- Now embed everything from the file -->
        <p>Something I have been dealing with during my PhD, is that it is really hard to describe the 3D geometry of a photonic crystal just using words. Having pictures helps, but doesn't always cut it.</p>
<p>I was mulling over this problem after I was excitedly trying to explain my recent results to friends, family and collegues.... and none of them had any idea what I was talking about... Fair enough.</p>
<p>I saw a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwtwOqdlY5E">video by Dr Fatima</a> a lil while back, where she mentioned a talk she saw where the speaker handed out 3D printed slices of the universe at different point ins time</p>
<p>💡💡💡</p>
<p>So: I 3D printed a scale model of my photonic crysal fiber.</p>
<p><strong>Behlod! A 200:1(ish) representation of a photonic crystal fiber slice</strong></p>
<p><img src="/Assets/3DPrintedPCF.jpg" alt="Blue plastic model of Photonic Crystal Fiber"></p>
<p>This is only a short section, because I wanted to verify that it will actually work.</p>
<p>I bought some translucent PETG so the next version will look kinda like glass (maybe) and I will print a longer section. I will update with a new post once I have this longer version.</p>
<p>In reality these fibers are less than a quarter milimeter in diameter, and made of glass, so a scaled up version is necessary.</p>
<p>Now in future talks and presentations, I will have hands on props to pass around. Hopefully this will help people understand what the device I am describing actually looks like.</p>

        <p>Has anyone ever studied the crystal lattice structure of a box of popcorn? Relevant research questions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do the crystal defects introduced by Peanut M&amp;Ms increase or reduce crystal strength?</li>
<li>How do Peanut M&amp;M defects compare with other confectionry based defects (e.g. regular M&amp;Ms, Reeces Pieces)</li>
<li>Is the traditional square pyramid profile of a popcorn box optimal? or can integrity by improved by alternate geometries?</li>
</ul>
<p>There may be an igNobel prize in this research. If you have thoughts please email me. I am only kind of joking about this.</p>

        <!-- Now embed everything from the file -->
        <p>I found this topic from <a href="https://jodiettenberg.substack.com/">Jodie Ettenburg's Curious About Everything Newsletter</a>, and considering the cool physics involved I had to re-share it here. Researchers at Northwestern University have just broke the record for the <a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/03/worlds-smallest-pacemaker-is-activated-by-light/">smallest pacemaker</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/Assets/Pacemakers.png" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p>From left, a traditional pacemake, a leadless pacemaker and the new pacemaker.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are my two favourite bits about it:</p>
<h2>It uses your BODY as the battery!</h2>
<p>Okay, so you know how in high-school you did the experiment wher you shoved a bit of copper and zinc into a lemon, and use that as a battery to power a lightbulb or something? Yeah, in this device, YOU are the lemon.</p>
<p>So typically, the way you power small temporary pacemaker is by using an inductive coil, and keeping the power supply outside your body. This is the same way your phones wireless charger works. The problem is that inductive charging coils are bulky.</p>
<p>The solution was to embed two different metal electrodes on the device, and use your body's fluid as the electrolyte. This battery is what powers the device.</p>
<h2>It uses light to control it!</h2>
<p>If that wasn't cool enough, they had to add cool optics into it as well. There is no compter or anything inside the device, instead it is controlled externally. The device is controlled through a photodiode, and an external heart monitor and infrared LED. When the heartmonitor detects irreglarities in the heartbeat, the LEDs light up, and transmit through the flesh to the device's photodiode control.</p>
<h2>It saves babies!</h2>
<p>The reason the device is designed to be so small, is that it is designed with newborn babies in mind, to help them if they are born with congenital heart defect.</p>
<h2>And it dissolves!</h2>
<p>Since the application is typically only temporary, the device simply dissolves into the body when it is no longer required. That way, you don't need surgery to extract it at the end.</p>

        <!-- Now embed everything from the file -->
        <p>It's frustrating that nearly every niche interest and hobby's main online community exists on Reddit, because Reddit is fucking terrible for fostering genuine communities.</p>
<p>If you go into any subreddit - I will pick on /r/3DPrinting for now - at least 50% of the posts are either &quot;Look at my very first print&quot; or &quot;Help me debug this issue&quot; (They absolutely did not google it before asking for help on reddit).</p>
<p>While there is nothing <em>inherently</em> wrong with introducing yourself to the community or asking for help, that's not what keeps experienced members engaged in the community. So you have all these newbie posts polluting the online community frustrating people who want to have deeper discussions about the hobby. And it isn't the newbies fault either, newbies need somewhere to share space with experienced people to get that experience.</p>
<p>Is this some unsolvable fact of life about online communities? <strong>NO!</strong></p>
<p>Traditional forums solved this by making separate threads for <em>introductions</em> and <em>help threads</em> and <em>memes / off topic</em>. We didn't just throw everything into one big list and wish you luck.</p>
<p>Anyway, can we go back to forums? I'm so sick of reddit man.</p>

        <!-- Now embed everything from the file -->
        <h1>Podcast is the best medium for horror fiction</h1>
<p>If you ever watch horror movies, you know that the anticipation is scarier than the reveal. The scraping noise against the window beats the monster reveal on the terror factor every time. This is the mistake that bad horror movies make when they reveal their monster too early.</p>
<p>The reason for this is simple. Your imagination will create a monster far more terrifying than the best CGI in the world.</p>
<p>So what if it’s all in your imagination? I truly believe that podcast is the best medium for horror fiction today. There are some extremely talented story writers partnering with equally talented audio mixers to create stories that suck you in and keep you terrified.</p>
<p>The best of these stories embrace the limitations of the medium. They are based around listening to the radio chatter during a crisis, or found audio recordings after the attack’s aftermath.</p>
<p>My favourite horror and thriller podcasts at the moment are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://thewhitevault.com/">The White Vault</a> – Very heavily inspired by <em>The Thing</em>, it follows an Arctic expedition that takes a bad turn. It does a really good job at putting the characters in “no-win” scenarios which force them to make terrifying decisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.derelictpodcast.com/">Fathom and its sequel Derelict</a> – This is the one that got me really into the medium. The audio production is phenomenal. Season 1 is set deep in an undersea base, the sound design—creaking metal, distant water rushing through cracks—builds an auditory environment so immersive, it’s crazy.</p>

<p>I fixed the RSS functionality of my site. If you missed anything from this year, feel free to go back and read my older articles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I added multiple feeds to my site. This one (the one you are probably subscribed to if you are reading this in your RSS reader), combines my blogposts, and shorter notes and links.
