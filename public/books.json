The narrative of it is mostly in the form of radio chatter which is a form I personally find gripping. Also kind of terrrifying to think how many terror plots get stopped, but it restored some level of my faith in instituitions to see the principaled stance that Tom and his team operated within.",

Turns out almost all the institutions I like were thanks to unions.

Without going too much into my own political ideology, I don't think it would be that surprising to most that I do not agree 100% with the political opinions espoused by a general of the U.S military. That said, I do think it is worth a read.

His core thesis is that we have moved beyond capitalism, and far from the socialist utopia which many predicted would be the downfall of capitalism, we ended up with something weird, and worse than capitalism. Very compelling read, and one of the more influential in how I currently percieve the world economy.",
