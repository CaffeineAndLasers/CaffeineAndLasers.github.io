The narrative of it is mostly in the form of radio chatter which is a form I personally find gripping. Also kind of terrrifying to think how many terror plots get stopped, but it restored some level of my faith in instituitions to see the principaled stance that Tom and his team operated within.",

Aleksik seems to be more optimistic about our algorithm future than I am, and I am not sure he convinced me. (I may just be cranky and cynical however). The one point I can confidently state that I disagree with: I think Aleksik overstates the effect of accents, because I think he over-estimates the proportion of posters-to-consumers on social media. I cannot see how a micro-cultural accent can occur when the line of communication is mostly mono-directional.",

The book was written with quite a high level of assumed knowledge, so if thermodynamics sounds like a scary word, I might suggest reading something more accessible.

From what I can tell, the central concept of \"Assembly Theory\" is somewhat controversial in Astrobiology circles, so I am not sure I am fully on board with the idea, but it is very interesting to engage with and think about. The book has me thinking a lot about the distinction between systems with selection, random systems and designed systems. I may have to write another blogpost about these ideas. Maybe one about Assembly Theory as well.",

It definately brought up some insights into ideology of some of these people, but the book felt a little bit too long IMHO.
