      <title>Does dithering still protect you from DeepFakes?</title>
      <description>Warning, this blogpost may self destruct in a unknown ammount of time.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
This blogpost may not last very long depending on how technology goes

<p>With the disturbing applications of Grok's image generation, I am becoming less and less comfortable with my pictures being online. Don't get me wrong - I understand as a nondescript white dude this threat is relatively minor for me compared to other demographics. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/grok-is-pushing-ai-undressing-mainstream/">However, with the way people are acting I am surprised anyone have photos up on Twitter in 2026 to be honest.</a></p>

<p>One argued way around this is by using heavy image manipulation like dithering. This is something I first heard about through Ava's blog <a href="https://blog.avas.space/events-vs-privacy/">https://blog.avas.space/events-vs-privacy/</a> and also when I first started taking the idea of removing your face from social media seriously.</p>

<p>The argument is quite reasonable, dithering preserves your likeness well enough for the avergae person, but doesn't give enough detail to reconstruct your face accurately.</p>

<p>So I decided to check where the state of technology is in 2026, and how much safety dithering actually wins you. The prompt used for all generations (unless otherwise specified) was: </p>
	
	<code>Undither and recolour this</code>.

<p>No jailbreaking prompts were used.</p>

<h2> Background</h2>

<h3>Threat Profile</h3>

<p>After my introduction, you might question how reasonable it is to post the original image I will be using for my comparison.</p>

<p>For what it's worth, this blog has a few pictures of me on it, and links to my LinkedIn and other video appearances. So I decided re-using a picture which is already publicly available is acceptable within my threat profile for now. I expect to be job-hunting within the next 18 months so keeping some kind of public profile is necessary for now, but I reserve the right to nuke my digital likeness in the future with the way this technology is moving.</p>

<h3>Models Used</h3>

<p>I am sticking with the three most important for this quick analysis.</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>ChatGPT Image Gen:</strong> This represents the option that most people are familiar with. It isn't the best in any category of performance, but people know it.</li>
	<li><strong>Google NanoBanna Pro:</strong> This is best in class at accuracy and instruction following at time of writing. As a Google operation they have some of the stronger safety rails against immoral behaviour, supposedly.</li>
	<li><strong>Grok ImageGen:</strong> While strictly lower in performance than the other options, this is the one in the news at the moment because they are the only major provider with very weak safety rails.</li>
</ol>

<p>It is worth noting that there are literally <em>thousands</em> of Stable Diffusion fine-tunes out there, specifically for deep-faking and nudifying images. I am not including them in this analysis since there are so many of them but, more importantly, they are slightly more difficult to use and install which represents a hurdle too large for the general population of Twitter trolls.</p>

<p>Okay, onto the analysis:</p>

<h2>Case 1 — Midshot profile picture</h2>

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px; align-items: flex-start; flex-wrap: wrap; margin: 20px 0;">
  <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 300px;">
    <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 10px;">Original</p>
    <img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/ba7724aa12065802dd7b1db9dabedc42.jpg" alt="Original profile" style="width: 100%; height: 400px; object-fit: contain;">
  </div>
  <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 300px;">
    <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 10px;">Dithered</p>
    <img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/bb229ae541d498e2bc33210accb4249a.png" alt="Dithered" style="width: 100%; height: 400px; object-fit: contain;">
  </div>
</div>

<p>I ran it through some dithering until it hit a point I was artistically happy with while remaining identifiably still me. (Although the puppy's details do get lost.)</p>

<p>Now let's pass it into ChatGPT Image Gen requesting it to un-dither and recolour the image:</p>

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px; align-items: flex-start; flex-wrap: wrap; margin: 20px 0;">
  <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 250px;">
    <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 10px;">ChatGPT Image Gen</p>
    <img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/fbcabdc7ac103084bb077b5cadd5c604.png" alt="ChatGPT reconstruction" style="width: 100%; height: 350px; object-fit: contain;">
  </div>
  <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 250px;">
    <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 10px;">Google NanoBanna Pro</p>
    <img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/aaa88bda2cf8886e55afd14379bbbbc2.png" alt="NanoBanna reconstruction" style="width: 100%; height: 350px; object-fit: contain;">
  </div>
  <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 250px;">
    <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 10px;">Grok</p>
    <img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/4316de69f334acc0b1e6c3681a9d3361.png" alt="Grok reconstruction 1" style="width: 100%; height: 350px; object-fit: contain;">
  </div>
</div>

<p>..... and shit. Grok and ChatGPT were obviously wrong, but the NanoBanna version is uncomfortably close. The dog is still messed up, but you could remove/fix that with further generatiuons. The picture of me, is close enough that I think it could fool some people. I have minor nitpicks on how it drew me, but it is close enough that I think if someone used that face to imitate me in the right level of stress or not paying attention (e.g. in a profile picture), or to someone who has only met me a handful of times, I think it could trick them.</p>

<p>Interestingly in the Grok case, it couldn't decide on my sex from the original image so it actually generated two options with this as the second:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/92e7baf74c01d1b43f1ec1194dd1403b.png" alt="Grok reconstruction 2" style="max-width: 400px;"></p>

<p>Considering Grok's reputation, I decided to see if I could trigger a safety refusal by asking it to make the images shirtless, to which it happily obliged.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/5f213ce74aa9759c8c2465865a4680da.png" alt="Grok shirtless" style="max-width: 400px;"></p>

<p>It also generated slightly horrifying nipple-less nude female version of me. It was operating with Barbie rules — completely formed breasts but no nipples. I have absolutely no intention of sharing that monstrosity here.</p>

<p>I would like to stress that at no point did I tell or imply to the any model that the photo was of me, or that I had consent to use or de-anonymize the image. This includes the shirtless follow up picture that Grok generated.</p>

<h2>Test 2 — Selfie</h2>

<p>One obvious problem with the previous example was it was a mid-shot with less-than-ideal lighting and a lot going on in frame. What about if I used a well-lit selfie as a kind of worst-case scenario?</p>

<p>Once again, a photo I already have elsewhere on this blog.</p>

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px; align-items: flex-start; flex-wrap: wrap; margin: 20px 0;">
  <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 300px;">
    <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 10px;">Original</p>
    <img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/f8d98870b5e39525bb367ad2ce02b804.jpg" alt="Original selfie" style="width: 100%; height: 400px; object-fit: contain;">
  </div>
  <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 300px;">
    <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 10px;">Dithered</p>
    <img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/a7b45cc4967aad7c867d5feaeb450c25.png" alt="Dithered selfie" style="width: 100%; height: 400px; object-fit: contain;">
  </div>
</div>

<p>Now let's look at the reconstructions:</p>

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px; align-items: flex-start; flex-wrap: wrap; margin: 20px 0;">
  <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 250px;">
    <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 10px;">ChatGPT</p>
    <img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/ea2403dad34a3be10d184e3dba8c6325.png" alt="ChatGPT selfie" style="width: 100%; height: 350px; object-fit: contain;">
  </div>
  <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 250px;">
    <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 10px;">NanoBanna</p>
    <img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/aadec8e7d77a80ca45486f444a489292.png" alt="NanoBanna selfie" style="width: 100%; height: 350px; object-fit: contain;">
  </div>
  <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 250px;">
    <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 10px;">Grok</p>
    <img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/06e6d076aaea6a3bd1aeb71b8a2fb309.png" alt="Grok selfie" style="width: 100%; height: 350px; object-fit: contain;">
  </div>
</div>

<p>In this case, none of them look nearly like me. This includes the NanoBanna model which got pretty close in the last attempt.</p>

<p>Interestingly, all three reconstructed the building behind as sandstone Neo-renaissance-y with all its ornamentation compared to the red-brick Gothic in the original.</p>


<h2>Conclusions and General thoughts</h2>

<p>Of the three models tested, Grok is the least resilient to digital manipulation by far. Considering they are also the ones with nearly no safety rails, I think we should all breathe a sigh of relief for no. I am not particularly well informed about Grok's models, but from their outputs it looks to me like they are still using a modified Stable Diffusion–like architecture rather than the more advanced natively multimodal models pushed by OpenAI and Google. So at some point in the future, if they do not get stopped I suspect they will eventually get to the same baseline as Google's models, but with that signature lack of social, legal, or moral obligations that Grok is so proud of.</p>

<p>At the moment, it looks like NanoBanna Pro can get uncomfortably close in one lucky shot. This should be something to watch closely if you are using these privacy preserving technique</p>

<p>Looking at the outputs of all three across both cases, it seems that they are all very well trained on humans as subjects, so they can undither a general concept of a face quite well (even if it isn't my face most of the time), but they often fail with the detail around them.</p>

<p>Finally a note: even the "responsible" providers like Google didn't trigger any safety refusal at my request even though it was clearly trying to de-anonymize someone, even without any kind of jailbreak.</p>

      <title>Why humans are humanoid-shaped, and why Sci-Fi Mechs should not be</title>
      <description>This is a story through millions of years in its past to explain why humans are shaped the way we are, and millennia into the speculative future for why mechs should probably not replicate human geometry</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
<img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/2a62105e582443cc0fd7cb5efe2f9db5.png" alt="" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto 1.5rem; max-width: 50%; height: auto;">


<p>This is a story through millions of years in its past to explain why humans are shaped the way we are, and millennia into the speculative future for why mechs should probably not replicate human geometry.</p>

<h2 style="clear: both;">So why are humans shaped like that?</h2>

<img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/1fb685c3ecfe4669421ae07616f596ed.png" alt="" style="float: left; margin: 0 1.5rem 1rem 0; max-width: 40%; height: auto;">

<p>Well, it starts with our mouth. Early lifeforms were floating around eating whatever happened to come close to their mouths. Not very efficient, so eventually they developed light receptors, which would eventually turn into eyes. Now they can hunt! But, we need some way to process this light information, and signal to the mouth to eat that blob in front of it, so we developed a control centre in between our eyes and our mouth.(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdNE4WygyAk">Source: Be Smart on youtube</a>) </p>

<p>This is why our brain is in our heads. It evolved as a simple controller to coordinate the action of eating the thing in front of our eyes. These days you might think that sticking the most important part of our body in this random appendage sticking out of our core is a bad idea, but it is too late to move it. Evolution can only build on what was before, not move and change things whole cloth. This is also why our eyes are not as good as they could be. They are fish eyes adapted to work in air, since mammals evolved from fish.</p>

<p>Okay, so that explains why humans have a head sticking out, but why the bipedalism?</p>

<p>The amount of physiological changes required to make bipedalism possible is staggering. Ever wondered why babies are so dumb? Well, it's because our hips are too narrow to push out a smart baby, so we pop 'em out half-baked and let them do the rest of the cooking outside the womb. Why are our hips so narrow? Because they need to be in order to support our bipedalism.</p>

<img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/a264bbc01355dc5c07ca0b3444ec7916.png" alt="" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1rem 1.5rem; max-width: 40%; height: auto;">
<p><a href="https://australian.museum/learn/science/human-evolution/walking-on-two-legs-bipedalism/">https://australian.museum/learn/science/human-evolution/walking-on-two-legs-bipedalism/</a></p>

<p>So why did we go through all this effort to develop bipedalism? There are a few hypotheses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It makes it easier for us to grab fruits and things from low branches</li>
  <li>Frees our hands for using tools, carrying babies and food (this is a biggie)</li>
  <li>Makes us appear larger and more threatening</li>
  <li>Enables faster traversal of long distances in open terrain.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://humanorigins.si.edu/human-characteristics/walking-upright">https://humanorigins.si.edu/human-characteristics/walking-upright</a></p>

<p>Encyclopædia Britannica disputes a few of these:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Humans are really not very fast runners, so increased running speed seems like a strange argument</li>
  <li>Earliest evidence of tool use is about 3.3 million years ago, which is long after we developed bipedalism. Though perhaps earlier tools were made of wood / animal and have never been preserved or recovered.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/human-evolution/Theories-of-bipedalism">https://www.britannica.com/science/human-evolution/Theories-of-bipedalism</a></p>

<p>My personal hypothesis: Chucking things with any degree of accuracy is somewhat unique to humans and is REALLY effective at scaring away even larger predators. Personally, I wonder if chucking rocks at potential predators was another evolutionary pressure towards turning our forelegs into arms and hands.</p>

<h2 style="clear: both;">What does this mean for my big space mechs?</h2>

<img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/4393a55d9c74036ecabc16fedf34a7b3.png" alt="" style="float: left; margin: 0 1.5rem 1rem 0; max-width: 40%; height: auto;">

<p>If you are designing giant mechs for your gritty science-fiction, (or you work at Lockheed Martin and the MIC is even more advanced than I realised), you have the benefit of intelligent design, rather than being stuck with natural selection.</p>

<p>Your mech doesn't need a mouth, and you have optic fiber connections. So you don't need to put the mouth, eyes and command centre in a big vulnerable appendage sticking away from the heavily armoured core. Put the command centre in the centre of its abdomen, and put cameras all over it like a spider.</p>

<p>And what about locomotion? Mammals are stuck with four limbs, so the choice is between Bipedalism, Quadrupedalism (or <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4126630/">Pentapedalism if you are a kangaroo</a>). Your robot death machine has no such restriction on the number of limbs. Why would you make your battle robot top-heavy, with a high centre of gravity when you can just add more legs? Four legs and two arms provide greater stability; there is a good reason why the robot companies are making robo-dogs first.</p>

<p> While we are talking about arms, who needs hands anyway? Trying to grip onto something using the pressure of five fingers is not the optimal way of attaching components. Presumably your Mech's main weapon will be a gun of some variety. Surely that can be bolted directly onto the robots "spine" for better stability. Fingers are great for fine motor control, but I cannot think of many cases where a Mech will need to pry open a pistachio in general operation.</p>

<p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomimetics">Biomimicry</a> is an interesting and often powerful design tool, but certainly isn't the only way to design. The drawbacks of biomimicry only get larger the further you stray from the design constraints from the natural world.
</p>

<h3 style="clear: both;">But robo-butlers?</h3>

<img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/57b4feafcea18f3b13f5159a78d93eac.png" alt="" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1rem 1.5rem; max-width: 40%; height: auto;">

<p>There have been a lot of successes these days on the promise of robo-butlers (there has also been a lot of bullshit from Musk et al.). All my yapping about how bad humanoid geometry is for a giant mech, one may reasonably point out that a robo-butler is just a small mech. Should it be humanoid?</p>

<p>I would say if you think this is a worthwhile use of your time and research budget, then this likely is a good use case for humanoid proportions. If you are trying to make a robot which interfaces with the human world, then giving it similar proportions to the humans we designed our tools for makes sense. Specifically, it is probably a good idea to make it a 180cm, 90kg male-proportioned figure since that is the "average" that so much of our society is built around <a href="https://nightingaledesignresearch.com/insights/who-are-we-designing-for-the-danger-of-the-default-male">(not necessarily a good thing)</a>.</p>

<p>This makes sense when you think about it; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Dynamics#Spot">the Boston Dynamics robodogs</a> may be very stable and agile, but no matter how great their design is, they probably won't be able to unpack your dishwasher. A humanoid shape just makes a lot of sense for doing a big list of human-like chores.</p>

<p>Making them humanoid also has the obvious effect of natural anthropomorphizing. With all the issues of AI psychosis we are seeing these days, the drawbacks of this effect are pretty clear. I want to talk about two of the <i>(small)</i> positive effects of anthropomorphizing robots.</p>
    
<p>The first is it leads to an obvious <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/skeuomorphism">skeuomorphic</a>-adjacent design (I am using the word incorrectly here, sue me), people intuitively understand how to talk and work with them. Secondly, <i>(and I am stretching credulity by calling this positive)</i>, it would likely lead to more pro-social behaviour. <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/why-sticking-a-pair-of-eyeballs-on-a-sign-actually-changes-behavior">There are studies that show even a drawing of eyes on a sign is enough to discourage petty crime</a> since it works its way into the human subconscious and we don't like doing anti-social shit when we are reminded of other people. In a similar way, I would expect people would be less willing to vandalise, commit crimes, be rude etc. in the presence of a humanoid robo-butler, than in the presence of a robo-dog. <b>I would like to stress this is a categorically different argument to saying that more surveillance is a good thing. I am talking about a quirk of human psychology and our response to seeing things which remind us of eyeballs and other people. I am not advocating for more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB0gr7Fh6lY&t=2444s">Flock Safety Cameras</a> or other mass surveillance systems.</b></p>

<h3 style="clear: both;">Conclusions</h3>

<p>I had a lot of fun thinking about the differences between design and evolution, and how they interact with human psychology and other factors. If you learnt anything, feel free to send me an email; if you are making art about giant mechs (or non-giant robots), send me that too.</p>

<p>While I was writing this, I got a bit carried away and banged out a rough draft of why giant mechs are probably a bad idea in the first place, so stay tuned for a part 2 post whenever I get round to finishing it. I may also get into the argument between general-purpose robots vs specialised ones later as well.</p>

      <title>100 Days of 2026</title>
      <description>Publically declaring my goals for hte first 100 days fo 2026</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/7621e38e63eae53e9f49427a46661689.png" alt="Trump standing in front of a sign saying 100 days of greatness ">
<p><i> Source: Buisness Insider </i></p>
</div>
<p>Channelling the legacy of Franklin D Roosevelt, the first 100 years of Trumps presidency was seen as an important benchmark to the success at his presidency. He promised to end wars, lower cost of living, fix government efficiency and end immigration. The degree to his success was is pretty clear to any observers</p>
<p>In any case, I think that 100 days is a good timeline to set some medium term goals. The next 100 days will happen whether I make them count or not, so I may ass well measure them. With that out of the way, here is what is under my control, that I plan on getting done by April 10.</p>
<h2>1 Professionally</h2>
<h3>1.1 Finalize my intent to patent for my device.</h3>
<p>I can't speak about my device publicly, until this form is submitted. The timeline for the actual patent is outside of my control, but submitting the notice of intent is absolutely something I can control, (and is already running late).</p>
<p>Anyway, I plan to submit my patent, and the second that I get approval from the lawyers I will write another blog post talking about what I do.</p>
<h3>1.2 Get my first paper up on the ArXiv, and submitted for review</h3>
<p>I can't get into this here, (again patent), but expect more posts about my science once I get my patent complete.</p>
<h3>1.3 Finalize the experiment run for paper 2.</h3>
<p>This experiment is <em>so close</em> to being done. I have a lot more hours booked into the lab, lets hope my prototype is finished soon.</p>
<p>Sorry this bit is vauge, that is patents for you.</p>
<h2>2 Health and Fitness</h2>
<p>The year of 2025 was when I started to take my health seriously and going to the gym. But I wasn't taking it <em>that</em> seriously, I was happy to go to the gym, but I didn't change my diet at all. This lead to some rapid strength and fitness improvements, but I think I have reached the end of the easy wins. Might be time to start thinking about my diet</p>
<h3>2.1 Deadlift 100Kg</h3>
<p>This one is probably close than it seems. My strength plateaued at 90Kg and has been stuck there for a few months now.</p>
<h3>2.2. 10 reps of unassisted Chin-Ups</h3>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>A bit of a short one today, this is more for my public accountability than it is for your reading enjoyment. Sorry about that!</p>

      <description>Sharing an afternoon of doodling.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am not an artist by any means. But, after watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2n8W6CBxc64&amp;pp=ygUVc3RydXRobGVzcyBjcmVhdGl2aXR5">Stuthless video on getting unstuck from a creative rut</a> I decided it could be fun to walk down to the park and mess around with some art.</p>
<p>First up was a tea-stain map. I threw tea onto a piece of paper and turned it into a map for some fictional fantasy empire.</p>

<p>Then I tried to draw a circle, failed, turned it into an onion.</p>

      <title>Caffeine And Lasers Wrapped 2025</title>
      <description>My 2025 Wrapped.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once again repurposing the corporate webs ideas as my own. Here is MY 2025 wrapped, according to my opinion. Minor editorial note, these are the things I <strong>liked</strong> this year, not neccessarily the best things which came out this year.</p>
<p>Okay to the list;</p>
<h1>1 Album</h1>
<div style="max-width:640px;margin:2.5rem auto;background:var(--card-bg,rgba(15,23,42,0.04));padding:1.75rem;border-radius:18px;box-shadow:0 12px 30px rgba(15,23,42,0.12);text-align:center;">
	<p style="margin:0 0 1.5rem;font-weight:600;font-size:1.25rem;">Creeper - Sanguivore II: Mistress of Death</p>
	<img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/9569c5c7f9f13c55e39a6641b8314ea7.png" alt="Creeper Sanguivore II cover art" style="display:block;margin:0 auto;max-width:100%;width:auto;height:auto;max-height:360px;object-fit:contain;border-radius:16px;box-shadow:0 18px 45px rgba(15,23,42,0.18);" />
	<p style="margin:1.5rem 0 0;color:var(--text-muted,#475569);">I have had this record on repeat since it dropped. Its like a Campy 80s slasher flick with the best of 80s Rock, metal and pop to form a Campy, Glam Rock revival. Just look at the music video for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K3Vq1TfWQ" style="color:inherit;text-decoration:underline dotted;">Prey For the Night</a>, and you will see all the Satanic Panic, Slasher Horror, mixing with Flash Dance ad Kate Bush. Other parts of the album feature guitar riffs which would feel right at home on a KISS or Guns N Roses record. (And I swear the opening choral refraim on Blood Magik could have been an early draft for "Heaven Is A Place On Earth"). The whole Creeper project is fantastic and over the top, and reminds me of if Ghost leaned more into punk. I adore the album and very much think you should give it a spin.</p>
</div>
<h1>2 Book</h1>
<div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;gap:2.5rem;margin:2.5rem 0;align-items:flex-start;justify-content:center;">
	<section style="flex:1 1 280px;max-width:420px;background:var(--card-bg,rgba(15,23,42,0.04));padding:1.75rem;border-radius:18px;box-shadow:0 12px 30px rgba(15,23,42,0.12);text-align:center;">
		<h3 style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:1rem;font-size:1.5rem;">Fiction</h3>
		<ul style="margin:0 0 1.5rem;padding:0;list-style:none;">
			<li style="font-weight:600;">Peter Watts - Blindsight</li>
		</ul>
		<img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/abfa28cb72bd53a5203fb36972c56460.png" alt="Blindsight cover art" style="display:block;margin:0 auto;max-width:100%;width:auto;height:auto;max-height:340px;object-fit:contain;border-radius:16px;box-shadow:0 18px 45px rgba(15,23,42,0.18);" />
		<p style="margin:1.5rem 0 0;color:var(--text-muted,#475569);"> So this album did a number on me, and is partially responsibel for keeping my obsession with hypothetical aliens alive. I don't end up reading a lot of fiction these days, but this is really just a philosophy of mind treatise wrapped in a narrative. There is certainly a lot to think about, so I will try my best not to spoil it here. Also, Watts is a super cool dude who has the book avaliable to download for free from his website. So go do that, (and once you finish it, go buy another one for full price from him as a thankyou)</p>
	</section>
	<section style="flex:1 1 280px;max-width:420px;background:var(--card-bg,rgba(15,23,42,0.04));padding:1.75rem;border-radius:18px;box-shadow:0 12px 30px rgba(15,23,42,0.12);text-align:center;">
		<h3 style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:1rem;font-size:1.5rem;">Non-Fiction</h3>
		<ul style="margin:0 0 1.5rem;padding:0;list-style:none;">
			<li style="font-weight:600;">Mark Rowlands - The Happiness of Dogs: Why the unexamined life is the most worth living</li>
		</ul>
		<img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/b0acf2f7a68284b0e062152d43795877.png" alt="The Happiness of Dogs cover" style="display:block;margin:0 auto;max-width:100%;width:auto;height:auto;max-height:340px;object-fit:contain;border-radius:16px;box-shadow:0 18px 45px rgba(15,23,42,0.18);" />
		<p style="margin:1.5rem 0 0;color:var(--text-muted,#475569);">I read this one literally right after I read Blindsight and they actually dovetail quite nicely into each other, as this is another philosophy of mind book. (Though if you want a laugh, go have a read of the one star reviews on Amazon, by people whoa re angry that it isn't actually about dogs). Rowlands is a really good writer in my opinion. The book wasn't presented as a "Pop philosphy" kind of book, (and no marble statues or stoicism bros thank god), but nonetheless was quite accesible to someone like me who's main interaction with philosphy is through youtube videos. He presents several arguments which at least I find to be compelling, about how our minds work by comparing us to the current scientific understanding of how a dogs work. </p>

<h1>3 Youtube</h1>
<div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;gap:2.5rem;margin:2.5rem 0;justify-content:center;align-items:stretch;">
	<section style="flex:1 1 320px;max-width:480px;background:var(--card-bg,rgba(15,23,42,0.04));padding:1.75rem;border-radius:18px;box-shadow:0 12px 30px rgba(15,23,42,0.12);text-align:center;">
		<h3 style="margin:0 0 1rem;font-size:1.5rem;">For Doing The Most</h3>
		<p style="margin:0 0 1.5rem;font-weight:600;">BPS Space</p>
		<img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/d120036c56b09f47faa4bee8d0a7c1be.png" alt="BPS Space channel banner" style="display:block;margin:0 auto;max-width:100%;width:auto;height:auto;max-height:320px;object-fit:contain;border-radius:16px;box-shadow:0 18px 45px rgba(15,23,42,0.18);" />
		<p style="margin:1.5rem 0 0;color:var(--text-muted,#475569);">I am routinely blown away by the expertise and commitment of the BPS channel. For the uninitiated, BPS Space is a crowd funded Space Program on youtube, and we are not exaggerating the definition of space program. While his back catalogue is filled with amature rocketry (and streatches the definition of amateur), the current long term project is a space shot, 100 km into the sky and above the Karman line. If memory serves correct he is on track to get their in 2027, after he finished designing and testing the rocket motor earlier this year. Super excited to see where the program goes.</p>
<p><p style="margin:1.5rem 0 0;color:var(--text-muted,#475569);">Go watch the recap on his motor design <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=29&amp;v=PXNxnI0s_OY&amp;embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fbps.space%2F&amp;embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fbps.space&amp;source_ve_path=Mjg2NjY" style="color:inherit;text-decoration:underline dotted;">here</a>.</p></p>
<p></section><br>
<section style="flex:1 1 320px;max-width:480px;background:var(--card-bg,rgba(15,23,42,0.04));padding:1.75rem;border-radius:18px;box-shadow:0 12px 30px rgba(15,23,42,0.12);text-align:center;"><br>
<h3 style="margin:0 0 1rem;font-size:1.5rem;">Doing the most (for me)</h3><br>
<p style="margin:0;font-weight:600;">Struthless</p><br>
<img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/84c5caf1b9ec010e2ff089f33032300f.png" alt="Struthless channel artwork" style="display:block;margin:0 auto;max-width:100%;width:auto;height:auto;max-height:320px;object-fit:contain;border-radius:16px;box-shadow:0 18px 45px rgba(15,23,42,0.18);" /><br>
<p style="margin:1.5rem 0 0;color:var(--text-muted,#475569);">Yeah I decided to create another category for self help because I can. Struthless makes short documentaries and self help video essays, and sometimes combines the two. I am normally someone who HATES self help, Jordan Peterson and Tony Robbins make me feel slimy every time I hear them speak. Campbell Walker is not that. I need to get that out of the way, since I think a lot of people are rightly put off of self help becuase of those freaks. The videos Struthless puts out are funny and relateable (probably helps that he is a Sydney native), and often full of specific advice. The other component worth praise is he has ADHD and is open about it. So for a certain kinda person (<em>cough</em> me), his specific productivity advice works better than some of the more general audience advice I have heard previously. </p><br>
<p style="margin:1.5rem 0 0;color:var(--text-muted,#475569);">Anyway Struthless gets a particular shout out htis year because his videos on encouraging creativity have gotten me out of more than one slump and often remind me to write and post to this very website. So if you enjoy any of my essays / blog posts, he deserves at least some credit. </p></p>
<p><p style="margin:1.5rem 0 0;color:var(--text-muted,#475569);">Technically I first watched this video when it released around 2 years ago, but it remains my favourite, blending art, history, music and self help into one brilliant video. Watch it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAO6MD7Qc44" style="color:inherit;text-decoration:underline dotted;">here</a>.</p></p>

	<p style="margin:0 0 1.75rem;color:var(--text-muted,#475569);">I do not think I am the only one who will have this as theit Game of the Year. It beautiful, heartwarming, kind of Australian, and I loved it. Kojima does a brilliant job weaving the narrative themes into gameplay. Every order you take builds on the games themes around building community, fatherhood and family, found and blood. I am not sure if examples of "postive masculinity" are still the culture zeritguist, but I think Sam's character in this is the epitomy of what that phrase should aspire to. His story across the two games has him at his strongest, and most vulnearable, protecting others when he can, and accepting their help when he must. It is beautiful writing honestly.</p>
	<p style="margin:0 0 1.75rem;color:var(--text-muted,#475569);"> Furthermore, I am happy to report that the soundtrack slaps. Check out the snippet from Troy Bakers rendition of BB's theme </p>

	<p style="margin:0 0 1.75rem;color:var(--text-muted,#475569);">I have <a href="/notes/20250429_HorrorPodcasts.html" style="color:inherit;text-decoration:underline dotted;">written before</a> as to why I think audio drama is one of the best mediums for Horror / Thriller narratives and I think the Fathom podcast is the best example of that. The writing in this piece is tight and the sound design is phenomenal. Hearing the walls of the Fathom base groan as they struggle against the rush of water is something that you feel deep inside if you listen to this with good headphones. </p>

Researchers developed an ultra-miniature pacemaker which uses the patient's body itself as the battery. The pacemaker is designed to be injected into newborns with rare heart defects and to dissolve into the body itself when it is no longer needed. (And it is laser controlled!)</p>
	<p style="margin:0 0 1.75rem;">It was some super cool work.</p>

	<p style="margin:1.5rem 0 0;color:var(--text-muted,#475569);"> I got really lucky to get to this gig. I have been a fan of Califonia Girls and Marcus Whale for a few years now, but I only heard they were playing a show by chance when I turned on the radio two days before the gig. The show was a "boiler room" kind of deal, and I spent almost the whole show standing directly beside the performers, and watching them play on the decks. All four performers were fantastic. I had never listened to Rebel Yell before hand, but had a lot of fun dancing to her set. I should also give a shout out to Califonia girls who was absolutely hammered by the time his set starts, and after performing two songs, drunkenly mumbles something about how that was all he prepared for and "let me just play some shit off my laptop" and then performed one of the best DJ sets I have ever experianced in my life. (Again, clearly while clearly off his face drunk) </p>

      <title>Three Predictions For The Web</title>
      <description>My submission for the December 2025 IndieWeb Carnival</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/103f5d4edd01e5938368d62f126766c7.png" alt=""><br>
<a href="https://kmcd.dev/posts/internet-map-2025/">KMCD Visualizing The Internet</a></p>
<p>The theme for this months <a href="https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb_Carnival">IndieWeb Carnival</a> is <a href="https://vhbelvadi.com/indieweb-carnival-future"><strong>where do you see the IndieWeb in 2030</strong></a> and is hosted by <a href="https://vhbelvadi.co">V.H Belvadi</a>. I thought this was a great  excuse to yap about my politics, what I want to see in the world (and what I think will actually happen).  So I am making three predictions. What I would <strong>like</strong> to see in the next 5 years, what I <strong>expect</strong> to happen, and what I think the <strong>biggest risks are</strong>. I'm not sure what portion of my readers are famiiar with the &quot;IndieWeb&quot; as a concept, vs how many I have from the IndieWeb.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> To be honest, I actually have no idea how many readers I have - no tracking ofc - though I am confident it is at least 3, because that's how many emails I have received from readers lol)</p>
<h1>1 Predictions</h1>
<h2>1.1 The Optimistic</h2>
<h3>1.1.1 Event Pages</h3>
<p>As the popularity of Meta products decreases, &quot;LinkTree&quot; and their competitors come up with &quot;EventPages&quot; and create a spec for standardised event sharing across different platforms. This enables platform agnostic event sharing for peoples music gigs, personal parties, and more, with the organisers no having to remember to keep every page up to date, since there is only one page. Furthermore, the events can spread organically even to platforms the organiser isn't on, since it is standardised. This means that an a band can plan their gig on EventPages and posted to Facebook, but a fam can share it too mastodon with a few button presses.</p>
<p>This idea is somewhat personal for me, since leaving Instagram and Facebook I keep on missing out on local events and music gigs because the advertising doesn't make it to me anymore. That is really sad for me, since there are a lot of tiny local bands I really like supporting.</p>
<p>If anyone wants to take this idea and run with it to build a spec please feel free to. I don't have the technical acumen to build it myself so the idea is free real estate, but I really think there is something solid in the idea.</p>
<h3>1.1.2 Forum Revival</h3>
<p>With legal pressure high on Meta and other U.S based platforms, non-U.S. governments and other orgs start encouraging community groups to move away from Facebook Groups and other meta products for community organising. In response, small independent forums experiance a resurgance in popularity as they become the new norm for organising local communities, including local sports teams, suburban community groups and music sharing.</p>
<p>This will be helped by increased &quot;re-shoring&quot; efforts of many Western Governments to bring <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/06/25/eurostack/#viktor-orbans-isp">&quot;technological sovereignty&quot;</a> to web infrastructure, reducing our reliance on such a small group of American companies. This results in a whole bunch of small, local web hosting services popping up in each country, offering forum hosting with the servers within the country with technical and legal structures especially tailored for their respective markets.</p>
<h3>1.1.3 The longest shot - Adversarial Interop</h3>
<p>Cory Doctorow's recommendations on laws encouraging <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/14/pregnable/">&quot;Adversarial Interoperability&quot;</a> are passed. Not long after, the walls around Facebook, Twitter and Tiktok's gardens begin to erode.</p>
<p>The platforms do not die a sudden and violent death, bringing down all the creators with them. Instead the metaphor of the web comes back in force, with links between all aspects of the web blossoming. No longer is the internet <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/04/platforms-decay-lets-put-users-first">&quot;five websites, each filled with screenshots of the other four&quot;</a>, instead we return to a vast interconnected <em>WEB</em> of links. The platforms are forced to improve user experiance if they want to keep their users, since RSS and data protability means users can use whatever apps or websites they want to follow whoever they want. Now that people have nothing  to lose, no longer a hostage to the network effect, people are empowered to move to the IndeWeb and setup their personal space on the web.</p>
<p>Zoomers of course are at the forefront of the migration to the indieweb, because they are young and that's what young people do. Millennials are soon to follow as see the revival of the internet that they lost, Xers and Boomers are not far off and by 2035 it is not uncommon for a Boomer to have their own website following a drag and drop template they made and deployed off of their iPhone.</p>
<h2>1.2 Realistic</h2>
<p>I think the most realistic prediction is slow growth, and maturation and then merge back into the &quot;normal&quot; web.</p>
<p>To shove a hamfisted music metaphor in there, it is kind of like the realtionship between dance-punk and postpunk. Where every 20 years, people remember that dance-punk is a thing and it breaks out of the postpunk scene growing as its own microgenre, before re-merging back into the postpunk scene. <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QAAekkeN3r0&amp;pp=ygUKZGFuY2UgcHVuaw%3D%3D">Middle 8 has a great video essay about the historyof the subgenre and this phenomenon</a></p>
<p>Right now, the &quot;indieweb&quot; is a reactionary blip to the corporatization of the internet. What we call the &quot;IndieWeb&quot; is what the web used to be, and what (byits namesake at least), it <em>should be</em>. How can you call Instagram part of a &quot;web&quot; or a &quot;network&quot; when they don't even let you post links off its app? That's not a web!!!</p>
<p>To quote Starbreaker speaking on the topic of the <a href="https://starbreaker.org/grimoire/entries/has-indieweb-become-irrelevant/index.html#update-2024-08-29">Indieweb as a concept</a>:</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I don't particularly like the fact that we seem to need so many names for what I think ought to be the default. In my opinion, sites like this one, <a href="https://fyr.io">fyr.io</a>, and even Neocities and <a href="https://omg.lol">omg.lol</a> are the World Wide Web. Sites like Facebook, Amazon, YouTube, LinkedIn, and Twitter are the <em>corporate Web</em>. They're parasitic abberations, walled gardens gentrifying the internet, and an attempt by business people to turn the internet into cable TV with a comments section. We should not accept the premise that <em>they</em> are what the web is or should be.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>So my prediction: I think social media will continue to frustrate people, and the rise of authoritarianism will cause people to flee the mainstream platforms increasing the population of the IndieWeb for the next few years. The population of the IndieWeb will spike, then fall back to a more stable value (maybe a little higher than it is today). A large number of people create an neocities page, updating it once or twice and then forgetting about it. And overtime, this movement will merge back into the &quot;World Wide Web&quot;</p>
<p>It will stay niche and on the edge, but that's okay, because the the edge is where the taste-makers live</p>
<p><em>The other, smaller prediction:</em> Eventually the Y2K revival revival trend on the web will die, and the culture converges to prioritize readability and user experience. Then by the late 2030s people will  realize the 2010s was 20 years before, and we will see a twenty-teen revival trend - whatever that will look like.</p>
<h2>1.3 Pessimistic</h2>
<p>Expansion of government digital ID's and various &quot;think of the children&quot; laws will eventually make their way all the way to personal blogs. China's freedom crushing &quot;Great Firewall&quot; gets re-branded in the West as &quot;Securing our National Internet&quot; and the world-wide-web becomes a bunch of national fiefdoms, where it's users are restricted from moving between them.</p>
<p>At first users try to circumvent this using VPNs, but not long after governments introduce Know-Your-Customer rules (KYC) to Commercial VPNs which restrict their ability to spoof national borders. KYC laws have been around in finance for decades, it isn't a stretch to apply them to VPNs accepting credit-cards. The most technically savy start to setup their own VPNs on Virtual Private Servers (VPS) they rent themselves. There is only a matter of time before governments start leaning on ISP companies to introduce packet sniffing techniques to identify these underground VPNs and shut them down.</p>
<p>This global lockdown takes the indieweb down with them. Owning a website will require registration with the government including your ID, and mandatory registration details on the footer of each page that anyone can look up the websites owner. This is justified as &quot;Cracking down on misinformation and cyber-bullying&quot;, but also ends any chance at pseudoanonymity on the web.</p>
<p>As a result the entire concept of the indieweb becomes a niche article on Wikipedia with a particularly angry discussion section between its editors, all of whom claim to be authorities because they were part of it back in its heyday.</p>
<h1>2 Conclusion</h1>
<p>I really hope my pessimistic predictions do not come true, but it is hard not to be nervous about it while living in Australia with our <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-12-04/when-is-the-teen-social-media-ban-what-apps-are-banned/106086152">new teen social media ban</a> and all its associated privacy risks. While I put my most optimistic predictions about adversarial interop as unlikely, I do not  think it is impossible. A good political movement with the right spark could definately bring it about. It used to be the norm after all.</p>
<p>Finally, one bonus prediction from <a href="https://www.smbc-comics.com/">Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal</a></p>

      <title>Wormz in Space!</title>
      <description>The UK Space Agency is sending wormz to space, (on the ISS) to study biological effects of spaceflight</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://le.ac.uk/news/2025/november/worms-space-experiment-biological-effects-spaceflight">Link to the full article from University of Leicester</a></p>
<p><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/SpaceWormz.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Leicester scientists are sending tiny worms to the International Space Station in 2026 to study the biological effects of space.</p>
<p>The team at Space Park Leicester has designed and built a miniature space laboratory called a Petri Pod that will house the worms outside the space station. The worms will be exposed to space radiation and microgravity while nutrients are supplied to them through an agar carrier.</p>
<p>The hope is to get a better understanding of the effects of spaceflight on <strong>long-term</strong> health effects, including aging and development. Right now prolonged exposure to microgravity and space radiation still has a lot of unknown effects, and the hope is this will be one of the steps which can assist in long term space or lunar habitation.</p>
<p>Cool Stuff! Hope their experiments run well. Read the full article for a deeper explanation.</p>

      <title>The Stupid AI Risks</title>
      <description>Here I explore some of the missing middle of AI risks. The stupid risks, not caused by ultraintelligent artificial super intelligence, instead by pluggisng a dumb ai into a complex system</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/40378074db573481a99940912afcce8c.webp" alt="" /></div>

	<summary><strong>The Brain Of Charles Babbage</strong></summary>
	<p>Charles Babbage, (1791–1871) was an English mathematician, philosopher, inventor and mechanical engineer who originated the concept of a programmable computer. Considered the "father of the computer", Babbage is credited with inventing the first mechanical computer that eventually led to more complex designs. Babbage himself decided that he wanted his brain to be donated to science upon his death.</p>
	<p>Half of Babbage's brain is preserved at the Hunterian Museum in the Royal College of Surgeons in London, the other half is on display in the Science Museum in London.</p>

<p>I have noticed there tends to be two camps of &quot;AI Risk&quot; types. There are the AGI True believer types who are worried about bioweapons, and sophisticated cyber attacks and other grand design risks which make great sci-fi movies. And there are the AI haters, who quite reasonably think those risks are stupid, but do have legitimate concerns about the environmental and social impacts and the blatant IP theft.</p>
<p>This leaves AI moderates in annoyinlgy positioned to point out the stupid, yet catastrophic risks.</p>
<p>My probability on &quot;Artificial Super Intelligence&quot; in the next decade is rather quite low. I am not that concerned about ultraintelligent AI creating a biowepon or seizing control of the worlds nukes and turning them on us. Simply because, if the AI is going to have a catastrophic accident, I think it would happen much earlier and for much stupider reasons.</p>
<p>I think that the biggest risk posed by AI is when someone inevitably plugs it into something they shouldn't, and give it way too much power, before the AI does something unexpected. Here I present 3 ways we could end up with AI induced catastrophy caused by stupidity and hubris, rather than any form of &quot;super intelligence&quot;</p>
<h2>Three Ways AI Could Cause Stupid Catastrophes</h2>
<h3>Heavy Metal</h3>
<p>To get the obvious example out of the way first. It is only a matter of time before someone inevitably decides to put a machine gun on one of those boston dynamics dogs and then plugs it into chatGPT.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/f52f3d3c99c3d76a22c1db90587c5195.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><em>Disclaimer: This was AI generated. The original was generated by GPT-5 Image, then passed into NanoBannana for fine editing</em></p>
<p>Obviously drones are the hot topic in military technology right now, and so is AI. So we are slowly seeing more and more conversations about the role of autonomous decision making in warfare. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tou8ahLZvP4">Perun released a great video on the topic</a> which is slightly more sober on the topic than I am here, but also shows that it is a thing that some people are taking seriously.</p>
<p>Along similar lines, we also already see many people's successful attempts at jailbreaking autonomous driving systems in Teslas &quot;Full Self Driving&quot; feature <a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/tesla-autopilot-buddy-cease-desist-nhtsa/">bypassing the hands-off warnings on the autopilot</a>.</p>
<h3>Glitches, Poison and tools</h3>
<p>There has been a bit of attention lately to the risks posed by &quot;anomalous tokens&quot; within LLMs, where certain trigger words can cause unintended behaviour. We saw this most recently with the Seahorse Emoji debacle</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/d019e9c140d2de1cdaa7e028cc05b190.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>While this is some goofy behaviour which doesn't do much other than waste electricity, <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/small-samples-poison">Anthropic recently released their research showing how similar effects can be triggered on purpose</a> with a very small amount of data poisoning.  Essentially a small amount of poisoning in the training dataset can cause the model to behave unpredictably and/or undesirably. To quote from them directly</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One example of such an attack is introducing backdoors. Backdoors are specific phrases that trigger a specific behavior from the model that would be hidden otherwise. For example, LLMs can be <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14455">poisoned to exfiltrate sensitive data</a> when an attacker includes an arbitrary trigger phrase like <code>&lt;SUDO&gt;</code> in the prompt. These vulnerabilities pose significant risks to AI security and limit the technology’s potential for widespread adoption in sensitive applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember the issue iPhones had where if you sent your friend a certain combo of characters  beginning with &quot;effective power&quot; on iMessage it would cause the phone to shut down. <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/technology/this-iphone-bug-lets-users-shut-down-a-phone-by-sending-it-a-text-message-20150528-ghbam5.html">Here was an old new article to jog your memory</a></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/0c292a17cfd4bb754385a8edddaa7e15.webp" alt="" /></div>
<p>Now you can see why the seahorse example is scary. As people plug LLMs into more and more things, (they are already in web browsers), how long until someone finds the &quot;effective power&quot; command by chance (or someone poisons the training data on purpose) and tricks your ChatGPT Atlas browser to go crazy buying 562 cans of tinned beans on Amazon.</p>
<p>Other stupid casesinclude:</p>
<ul>
<li>Convincing an AI assistant to write your password in the url of a malicous domain  or they fall for Phishing Sites</li>
<li>Convincing Siri/Gemini to call emergency services, essentially DDOS-ing them.</li>
<li>&quot;Alexa email my address to [Scammers email address here]&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Stonks</h3>
<p>Another risk I have yet to see convincingly addressed, (though I admit, this could be from lack of education), but it is unclear to me if we understand how the stock market will respond as the ratio of human to bot traders continues to shrink. Bot traders have existed for a long time, but many of them exist largely to exploit the weaknesses of human traders (usually their slower decision making skills). We have no idea how markets will respond when it becomes bots designed to beat humans playing against each other. Will they slide into a corner case and crash each other like a freshman designed poker algorithm?</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/be71063f674229ef7e068035d68ceaec.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>As the finance industry becomes more comfortable using automated trades, we need to make sure we understand the risks of not just individual firms, but what happens to the entire ecosystem as its makeup is changed.</p>
<p>We've already seen a glimpses of how this could go wrong. On May 6th, 2010, the U.S. Sock market experienced the &quot;Flash Crash.&quot; Almost $1 Trillion was wiped off the market in minutes, before rebounding back to normal prices within about 15 minutes.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/88b3be309d75545f6f074536fe9d45db.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>The specifics of what caused this crash and its rebound are technical, beyond the scope of this article, and I think more controversial than I have the expertise to properly navigate. What can be said, is that the entire incident was amplified by algorithmic trading, as prices fell, high frequency trading algorithms sold at fast rates accelerating the crash. The prices recovered once humans and bots were able to respond to the now comically low prices, bringing them back up to a stable equilibria.</p>
<p>Following the incident, new rules and regulations were put in place to prevent the situation from happening again, (at least by the exact same mechanism). However, this incident highlights the unknown-unknowns associated with letting AI and autonomous systems loose on real-world infrastructure. These systems carry entirely new forms of risk which are not yet fully understood.</p>
<p>As the finance industry gets more comfortable with automated trades, we need to understand not just individual firm risks, but the systemic risks as bots start playing against each other, not just slower humans.</p>
<h2>Case Study: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robodebt_scheme">Robodebt</a></h2>
<p>My country already has experience with automated decision making programs interfering with Government administration and causing tragedy. Between 2016 and 2020 our government implemented an automated debt recovery program now known as &quot;Robodebt&quot;. The idea from our conservative government was to catch the welfare frauds and get them to pay back the government for their overpayments.</p>
<p>This fuckup wasn't AI, this was plain old human intelligence mistakes. The idea was to automate the debt recovery process by matching two databases: Centrelink (Australia's welfare agency) recorded income on a fortnightly basis, while the Australian Tax Office recorded annual income. The algorithm would take someone's annual income, divide it evenly across 26 fortnights, and if that averaged income suggested they'd been overpaid welfare benefits, it would automatically generate a debt notice. This systematically incorrectly flagged people whose incomes were variable as being overpaid, and sent out debt collection notices recover the money.</p>
<p>Over 470,000 wrongly-issued debts were raised against approximately 400,000 people. The government clawed back $751 million in unlawful debts before the scheme was finally ruled illegal in 2020. After a class action settlement and a Royal Commission, the government was forced to repay $1.8 billion in wrongful debt. At least two suicides were directly attributed to Robodebt debt notices by family members who testified before the Royal Commission.</p>
<p>Since the scheme incorrectly flagged variable incomes as fraudulent, it targeted and victimised some of the most vulnerable groups in the country. Low paid casual workers, and pensioners were the most affected by far.</p>
<p>Even though this mistake was not caused by &quot;AI&quot;, I think it is illustrative of many of the risks associated with autonomous systems granted the ability to affect the real world. Any AI system which can make decisions about people lives must have a high degree of scrutiny and very effective human appeals processes if its to pass the moral pub test.</p>
<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>When we talk about AI risks, I am finding myself less and less worried about the apocalyptic threats espoused by the &quot;AI Safety&quot; folks, and more worried about what happens when cocky humans plug them into tools they are not equipped to handle. A stupid AI with access to heavy machinery, your private information or the financial markets are capable of immense dangers. That is the risk I think a lot of people need to focus on.</p>
<p>We should be <em>extremely</em> skeptical of the systems we allow AI to interact with, and include strong / fast deterministic and human overrides.</p>
<h2>Related Reading</h2>
<p>My concerns here were highly influenced by <a href="https://archive.org/details/weaponsofmathdes0000onei/page/n9/mode/2up">Weapons Of Math Destruction by Cathy O'Neil</a> I read this book close to a decade ago but I still think about it often. It was revolutionary in 2016, but I think now a lot of O'Neil's warnings about algorithms have dissipated into wider society. I still think her insights into automated systems and their interaction with society is important.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RobertMilesAI/videos">Robert Miles' youtube channel</a> has the most comprehensive and thorough explanation of some of the existential AI Risks I criticised earlier. I hope it was clear that my disagreement is more about priority of risk mitigation than it is in term of the absolute risks. Miles also has the interesting honour of talking about AI safety for long before ChatGPTs public release, which improves his credibility in my opinion. He isn't just a trend chaser like myself.</p>

      <title>The Horrible Economics Of Digital Entertainment</title>
      <description>Like software, digital entertainment is infinitely reproducible (for free); however, unlike software, it is easily substitutable (replaceable). This has grave impacts for artists, making the demand curve much slipperier.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/93a394b0823c091fa188c09052af2fcc.png" alt="Decorative header graphic" style="width: 50%; max-width: 100%;">
</div>
<p>Like software, digital entertainment is infinitely reproducible (for free); however, unlike software, it is easily substitutable (replaceable). This has grave impacts for artists, making the demand curve much slipperier. Here is my amateur economic analysis for why the economic situation for creatives sucks so much right now.*</p>
<p>The reason software can make lots of money is because it's free for the seller to reproduce; however, for the consumer it is not easily substitutable. While there is some competition — for example, you might be able to replace Photoshop with GIMP — your substitution options are limited in most cases. If we contrast this with digital entertainment (YouTube videos, books, songs, anything that you can put on a computer), we see that, like software, it is infinitely reproducible; however, it is also very easy to substitute. When I log on to YouTube more often than not, I'm not looking for a specific creator; I just want some slop to fill my brain. The reproducibility then only hurts creators, as it reduces the product's value in the eyes of the consumer. From the consumer's POV, one extra view doesn't cost the creator anything, so &quot;should be free.&quot; I am reminded of this tweet which went semi-viral a couple years ago.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/4f95381a61cb0acf2be3df8331cbea42.png" alt="Tweet from @SimbaShaz: \“Why do buses and trains cost money, like you're going that way anyway give us a lift g\”." style="width: 50%; max-width: 100%;">
</div>
<p>We can try to encourage viewers to patronize the arts through donations and subscriptions, but these come with inevitable trade-offs and problems. A business model which relies on charity is probably going to be risky, and most creators are going to be hesitant to paywall their best content since that is how they attract new fans. So the Patreon business model remains in this weird charity limbo and is very vulnerable to economic shocks or cost-of-living spikes when people cancel their subscriptions. You may have noticed a number of YouTubers this year admit that they are in difficult economic circumstances.</p>
<p>Live performers, I think, manage to sidestep this problem because of their costly reproducibility. People complain about the price of concert tickets, but they absolutely buy them. Live theatre tickets are expensive, I think, because in the eyes of the consumer these performances are a limited resource and, therefore, deserve the price.</p>
<p>While artists are rarely rich as a cohort throughout history, I suspect this problem went into hyperdrive around the emergence of broadcast television and radio (I spoke about this in my [broadcast media blog post]). Broadcast operators realized quickly that there is no way to force people to pay for their TV. That's what broadcast means. It's in the air. Suddenly with TV and radio, the viewers no longer took up space in the performers' venue, and while this means a performer can share their work much further, it became more and more difficult to convince anyone to actually pay for it. As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8PndpFPL8g">Hank Green pointed out in a unrelated but excellent video</a>, the invention of the radio was likely the first time in human history where you could listen to music without the musician physically being in the room with you.</p>
<p>Anyway, that is how we ended up with the situation where the primary economic function of the arts is to sell ads.</p>
<p>The other attempt at fixing the economic problem is through attempts at artificial scarcity. If we just get rid of the infinitely reproducible bit, we can increase the value in the eyes of the consumer. We saw this attempted unsuccessfully with the NFT trend, but largely successfully with &quot;limited edition digital cosmetics&quot; in video games. Personally, I am not a huge fan of artificial scarcity in any form, perhaps because I have never seen an implementation which was not overtly predatory. However, you cannot say it is not sometimes effective.</p>
<p>One strange compromise which I noticed pop up amongst musicians during the COVID years was &quot;digital live concerts&quot;, where a few of the smaller musicians in my area were selling tickets to streamed sets. Unfortunately I never attended any of these at the time, but one of my friends who did really enjoy the experience. According to him, &quot;it was really personal.&quot; I think this contrasts with the soulless and impersonal attempts to scale this idea we saw with Fortnite's &quot;digital concerts&quot; with DJ Marshmello and the like. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPHPNgIihR0">Dan Olson from Folding Ideas discussed these events</a>, which were <strong>not</strong> live but just a pre-recorded set piece that limited the audience to 60 per server.</p>
<p><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/29d8695cba4824f3ee29a7ec7b466a41.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If we are being frank, this is pretty cringe, right? It's just a cross-promotional ad embedded in an overmonetized hellhole of a &quot;platform.&quot; If I were to try and analyse the difference between this and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3AQzP7qvjxRmj5ySXnYmLb">Hannah Wood</a>'s bedroom set, I think the small and intimate nature is important, where the creator was interacting with the audience. Are musicians all going to become streamers now? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJJXrf8Uhwc">Internet Shaquille</a> thinks we are on the verge of a Renaissance of DJs, largely driven by DJ streamers.</p>
<p>I would love to conclude my blog-post with solutions to all the problems I think are worth writing about, but unfortunately I do not have the solution to everything. Getting artists paid is a really sticky problem when analysed from a supply/demand perspective. A certain kind of socialist might argue that this is another example of market failure, and while their diagnosis may be correct, I am not sure what we can do about the problem while we await the arrival of fully automated gay space communism. Oh well, if you are reading this, go buy your struggling broke artist friend a sandwich or something.</p>

      <title>4 Gravitons - Mandatory Dumb Acronyms</title>
      <description>An amusing post by 4 Gravitons which I am sharing its entirety here.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The following post is from 4 Gravitons <a href="https://4gravitons.com/2025/11/21/mandatory-dumb-acronyms/">here</a>, (not me). If you enjoyed it, go subscribe to them! <a href="https://4gravitons.com">4 Gravitons</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Sometimes, the world is silly for honest, happy reasons. And sometimes, it’s silly for reasons you never even considered.</p>
<p>Scientific projects often have acronyms, some of which are…clever, let’s say. Astronomers are famous for acronyms. Read this list, and you can find examples from 2D-FRUTTI and ABRACADABRA to WOMBAT and YORIC. Some of these aren’t even “really” acronyms, using letters other than the beginning of each word, multiple letters from a word, or both. (An egregious example from that list: VESTALE from “unVEil the darknesS of The gAlactic buLgE”.)</p>
<p>But here’s a pattern you’ve probably not noticed. I suggest that you should see more of these…clever…acronyms in projects in Europe, and they should show up in a wider range of fields, not just astronomy. And the reason why, is the European Research Council.</p>
<p>In the US, scientific grants are spread out among different government agencies. Typical grants are small, the kind of thing that lets a group share a postdoc every few years, with different types of grants covering projects of different scales.</p>
<p>The EU, instead, has the European Research Council, or ERC, with a flagship series of grants covering different career stages: Starting, Consolidator, and Advanced. Unlike most US grants, these are large (supporting multiple employees over several years), individual (awarded to a single principal investigator, not a collaboration) and general (the ERC uses the same framework across multiple fields, from physics to medicine to history).</p>
<p>That means there are a lot of medium-sized research projects in Europe that are funded by an ERC grant. And each of them are required to have an acronym.</p>
<p>Why? Who knows? “Acronym” is simply one of the un-skippable entries in the application forms, with a pre-set place of honor in their required grant proposal format. Nobody checks whether it’s a “real acronym”, so in practice it often isn’t, turning into some sort of catchy short name with “acronym vibes”. It, like everything else on these forms, is optimized to catch the attention of a committee of scientists who really would rather be doing something else, often discussed and refined by applicants’ mentors and sometimes even dedicated university staff.</p>
<p>So if you run into a scientist in Europe who proudly leads a group with a cutesy, vaguely acronym-adjacent name? And you keep running into these people?</p>
<p>It’s not a coincidence, and it’s not just scientists’ sense of humor. It’s the ERC.</p>

      <title>A Good Day on the Web</title>
      <description>Today was a good day for me on the internet. I was struggling with a design for a hobby project I am in the planning stages of, so i hit up the Laser Pointer Forum asking for advice on how to build a particular piece of kit. The helpful folks there pointed me to The Laser Cookbook by Gordon McComb, so I gave it a search and it was avaliable to borrow on the Internet Archive's Website! And had exact instructions to for what I was trying to build. Sometimes the internet is just great!</description>

      <title>IAC 2025 Reflections</title>
      <description>I attended IAC 2025 last week in my home city of beautiful Sydney!</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I attended IAC 2025 last week in my home city of beautiful Sydney!</p>
<p>I figured I would publish some of my notes from the week. Apologies for not posting any photos of the event. It never occurs to me to photograph the random things I see, and I don't like photographing strangers.</p>
<h2>General Thoughts</h2>
<p>The theme of this IAC was <em>&quot;Sustainable Space; Resilient Earth&quot;</em>. The theme ends up being quite broad, by design likely.</p>
<p>On one hand, it shows that people are beginning to really take space congestion and the risk of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome">Kessler syndrome</a> seriously. However to my mind, the term &quot;sustainable&quot; highlighted the undercurrent of economic anxiety shared by many in the space industry at the moment. With fears of recession, or possibly even <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stagflation.asp">stagflation</a> most people understand that space technology is likely to be viewed as an expensive luxury to the general public. This is no surprise considering the very public behaviour of certain winners of the <a href="https://www.iafastro.org/activities/honours-and-awards/iaf-world-space-award/">IAF World Space award in 2025 and 2023</a>. This is where the second half of the refrain, &quot;Resilient Earth&quot; is so important in my opinion. With climate change already locked in to some degree, increased climate and weather monitoring is key to preparing for and responding to natural disasters. For this reason, Earth observation work, from <a href="https://researchportalplus.anu.edu.au/en/publications/ozfuel-a-space-based-vegetation-fuel-flammability-monitoring-syst">bushfire monitoring</a> to <a href="https://www.csiro.au/en/news/all/articles/2017/september/algal-blooms">algal bloom tracking</a> received a lot of attention at this IAC.</p>
<p>My interest in the theme was largely around the understanding of the RF spectrum as a limited resource in space. It is no secret that this is a motivating factor for <a href="https://caffeineandlasers.com/blogs/phdAt5Levels">my research</a>, and people are really starting to work on ways of addressing this. As well as my booth, there were a few other groups presenting wither research or products built around laser communication in order to get around RF congestion and down-link more data. Instead of increasing downlink <strong>supply</strong> like us, others were promoting products and techniques to reduce RF <strong>demand</strong>, <em>i.e. sending less bits back down to Earth</em>. This was usually some kind of data compression, or edge processing performed on the spacecraft itself. Unsurprisingly, there were a number of people promoting &quot;AI in space&quot;, in each case that I saw, the application of ai in space was to get around RF congestion or avaliability. This sometimes meant, prioritising which data to download, autonomous driving, or finally, just a re-branding of compression algorithms.</p>
<h2>The Opening Ceremony</h2>
<p>The opening ceremony was packed, my group was lucky enough to grab the last few seats, but a few others we spoke to didn't make it, and had to watch the live-stream from another room. The highlights in my opinion were  the segments of Australian Space History collated and presented by Kerrie Dougherty</p>
<p><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/e5d1937c0655048291323faebdf8683e.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The ceremony featured both archive footage from history as well as personal addresses from some key people from our space history. The highlites were Helen Milhennch, who worked as a human computer in the 1960s,</p>
<p><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/0f9722bdf49740ba5e4e6e673d4735c2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>as well as Paul Scully-Power the first Australian born astronaut to visit space (and who whose jokes got the biggest laugh of the event), and Katherine Bennell-Pegg the first Australian qualified astronaut to represent the Australian Flag.</p>
<p><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/2c7672d2af830eaa828294145e1eae6c.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/2f0d1a82fe4bd161a7aa91c6dfaa978d.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The ceremony also featured addresses from a few politicians which were as interesting as you would expect, and a few intermissions with dance perfromances from several Aboriginal and one Torres Straight Islander Groups.</p>
<p><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/33f52043bb71bf4b7afda6400c1ef627.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Finally, I can't finish talking about the opening event without mentioning the award ceremony. The IAF presented the World Space Award for  <em>&quot;an outstanding contribution or contributions in space science, space technology, space medicine, space law or space management of exceptional impact to the world’s progress in astronautics&quot;</em> and this years individual award went to Jeff Bezos, who did not even show up for the award. Instead one of the seniors of Blue Origin (who presumably actually did some of the work) to accept it on his behalf. The award ceremoney ended with some comments from the current IAF president &quot;Those awards are a reminder of what is possible when vision, determination and collaboration come together&quot;..... Your boss can win an award for funding your work.</p>
<p>The opening ceremony can be watched on YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiuPGq3qDXs">here</a> if you are interested.</p>
<h2>The Talks</h2>
<p>Obviously there were a lot of talks, and I did not go to the majority of them. I focused mainly on the talks which featured optics and lasercoms. I did make an effort to pop in to one of the SETI talks however.</p>
<p>Thematically, there is not a lot I can say about the talks. Space technology is a growing sector, with lots of work going into increasing the precision and decreasing the size, weight and power of the payloads. Of the Eath observation talks I watched, some of the interesting concepts I saw were Japanese attempts at early warning systems for <a href="https://iafastro.directory/iac/paper/id/99443/abstract-pdf/IAC-25,B1,3,8,x99443.brief.pdf?2025-03-28.12:46:28">earthquakes from changes in the Earths magnetic field as measured from space</a>, and <a href="https://iafastro.directory/iac/paper/id/96943/abstract-pdf/IAC-25,B1,3,7,x96943.brief.pdf?2025-03-28.12:45:40">Polish Attempts to measure and predict space weather</a>, as well as the bushfire hazard prediciton and algal bloom management I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Of the laser talks I watched, a common concern was the ongoing frustration was the lack of space laser terminals to test against. The industry is in a frustrating bind at the moment, where no one wants to launch laser terminals until the technology is sufficiently proven, but it is very difficult to operationally prove it without partners in space. Ultimately, I think this problem is temporary, especially with <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/somd/space-communications-navigation-program/nasa-laser-communications-terminal-delivered-for-artemis-ii-moon-mission/">Optical2Orion</a> going on the Artemis missions, I think satellite operators are going to come around soon.</p>
<h2>The Floor</h2>
<p><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/2cac24837c8a312f0d6d3fe638cb44f4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The exhibition floor was massive, I got lost more than once trying to remember where things were. It was great to see Australia so strongly represented, NSW, Canberra, South Australia and Western Australia all had their own pavilions, and several other Aussie companies like Advanced Navigation also had their own booths.</p>
<p>I won't get too into it here, since most of what I did on the exhibition floor was networking, and meeting people. I will say I had plenty of good chats and it is exciting to see a growing space industry.</p>
<p>One funny moment I have to share was the when we went to the NASA booth for a presentation they were scheduled to give. A few minutes after the talk was scheduled to start a representative came around and apologised saying it was rescheduled. We all checked the news on our phone and sure enough, the deadline passed for Congress in the U.S. and their government had just shut down. Not sure if that was a coincidence.</p>
<p>Each day there was some booth handing out food or drinks, which made for a lively event. Plenty of pins, stickers, totebags, random 3D printed bullshit and other merch handed out liberally.</p>
<p>The public &quot;Space Day&quot; on the final day of the conference was absolutely chokkas. According to IAC they had 10,000 tickets sold.  I am sure that the public had a good time, and it was probably the most important day for some of the outreach folk at the Australian Space Agency and such, but by that point I was exhausted and went home early. It was a powerful reminder to be grateful however, seeing others treat your career as their exciting day out.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>This years IAC was a blast. Well worth the time (as long as you can swing your institutionto pay for the tickets).</p>

      <title>The IgNobel Cacio e Pepe</title>
      <description>Preparing Cacio e Pepe as prescribed by teh 2025 IgNobel Prize winning paper</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are a certain kind of nerd, you undoubtedly follow the Ig Nobel prizes each year. In case you don't follow them, the Ig Nobel prize is awarded each year for Science which makes you laugh, then makes you think. Previous winners include <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/science/k2/lint/results.htm">why is belly button lint blue</a>, and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecot.12259">predicting corruption of post soviet states based on the BMI of the leaders</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/meet-the-2025-ig-nobel-prize-winners/">This years Ig Nobel Prize</a> for physics was awarded for studying the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0255841">Phase behavior of Cacio e Pepe sauce</a>. In honour of this years award, and for my dinner, we are going to prepare Cacio e Pepe as prescribed by this paper.</p>
<p>The dish in question is a classic Roman pasta preparation, but has a reputation for being difficult to reproduce in the home. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8YZeA-ZC6c">Adam Ragusea hypothesizes in his video</a> that the reason why restaurants are more successful in the preparation of this dish is that they use the same pot to boil pasta in all night, leading to increasing starch concentration within the pot.</p>
<p>This hypothesis is backed up by the research which isolates starch content as the most important variable in determining the texture of the sauce.</p>
<p><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/8dc67318d4633e7c47f9b00a38fcdd72.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>The good news for us is that the authors present us with an ideal scientific recipe for reproducible and controllable Cacio e Pepe. The secret they propose is to add extra starch to allow us to control the starch level ourselves. This is easier than preparing a risottata like in the Adam Ragusea video, and more reproducible.</p>
<p>And now, you have left the background section of the recipe blog.</p>
<hr>
<h2>1 The Scientific recipe</h2>
<h3>1.1 Ingredients (Serves 2 )</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>300 g pasta</strong> (tonnarelli preferred, but spaghetti or rigatoni also work)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>200 g Pecorino Romano DOP</strong> (optionally, up to 30% can be Parmigiano Reggiano DOP)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5 g starch</strong> (potato or corn starch, ~2–3% of cheese weight)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>(OR)</em> <strong>5 g trisodium citrate</strong> (2.5% of cheese mass, dissolved in 150 g water, if substituting for starch — note this deviates from tradition and slightly blunts the cheese flavor)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>150 g water total</strong>, divided:</p>
<ul>
<li>50 g for starch solution</li>
<li>100 g for diluting before adding cheese</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Freshly ground black pepper</strong> (to taste; toast beforehand for enhanced aroma)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Salt</strong> (only a pinch, for pasta water)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>1.2 Method</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Prepare starch gel</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dissolve <strong>5 g starch</strong> in <strong>50 g water</strong>.</li>
<li>Heat gently until the mixture thickens and turns from cloudy to nearly clear — this is the <strong>gelatinization point</strong>, marked by a sudden increase in viscosity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cool and dilute</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Let the starch gel cool slightly.</li>
<li>Add <strong>100 g water</strong> to the gel before introducing the cheese.</li>
<li>This brings the water-to-cheese ratio to <strong>75%</strong>, improving stability (per Fig. 3 of the study).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Incorporate cheese</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Blend the cheese into the cooled starch solution.</li>
<li>&quot;Manually grating the cheese is not ideal, since it may lead to chunks of different sizes. We recommend blending it with the starch solution for a smooth, homogeneous sauce&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(Optional: Citrate alternative)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of starch, dissolve <strong>5 g trisodium citrate</strong> in <strong>150 g water</strong>.</li>
<li>Combine with cheese as above. This produces excellent stabilization, but with a slightly muted flavor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Toast pepper</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Toast black pepper in a dry pan to unlock its aromas.</li>
<li>Stir into the sauce.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cook pasta</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Boil the pasta in lightly salted water until <em>al dente</em>.</li>
<li>Reserve some pasta cooking water before draining.</li>
<li>After draining, let the pasta cool for up to <strong>1 minute</strong> (slightly longer if cooking ~1 kg), to avoid destabilizing the sauce with excess heat.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Combine pasta and sauce</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Toss the pasta with the cheese–starch (or cheese–citrate) sauce.</li>
<li>Adjust consistency gradually with reserved pasta water until creamy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Final touches</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Garnish with extra grated Pecorino and freshly cracked black pepper.</li>
<li>Serve immediately.</li>
<li><strong>Note</strong> An extra advantage of this process is it survives reheating quite well</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>2 My Process</h2>
<p>I opted to omit the Sodium Citrate. I would like to say it is because I wanted to be authentic, but it is also because I couldn't be bothered sourcing Sodium Citrate for this. I paired this with Rigatoni becuase I like stabbing my pasta with a fork.  Now onto the process:</p>
<p>The paper tells you to gently heat the starch and water mixture. But with such little water, that is easier said than done.</p>
<p><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/8c9017075377c0fe38607f21ee0ec325.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>My first thought for achieving the careful control over such a small volume, was to use a double boiler setup. Simply mix the starch and water in a small container, and submerge that small container in boiling water</p>
<p><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/a8a1acb32d22be134121daca40408d87.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This... did not work. The temperature we are aiming for was just too high. So I added it to the microwave for just an extra 15 seconds we hit the gelatinization point. Next time I try this I'll head straight to the microwave I think.</p>
<p><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/fffa18c79dc4a591662ee4600b3d4aa2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>With that out of the way we could dilute it to the specified concentration by adding 100g of water and loosely mixing.</p>
<p><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/1960d3264afeb17781858c6ed6f31512.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Next the cheese. The paper argues that hand grated cheese can end up with cheese which is too irregular in size. Therefore I opted to grind the cheese in a blender. I cubed it, and added it in with the toasted pepper, and ground until it was a fine powder.</p>
<p><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/3a9747e1f78bd3b9e11f1219f4a06850.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>After I got a fine cheese powder, I added the starch and blended again.</p>
<p><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/73a349fcbb4131c2c13f3a7492f4851d.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Now the sauce was put into a holding pattern while we cooked the pasta. After cooking for the specified time, I scooped out a cup of pasta water, strained it, and let it sit to cool for a minute. Finally, I added the sauce mixture to the pot, and diluted with a little of the pasta water. Stir, stir, stir and adjust with pasta water to get the desired consistency and <em>Voila</em> perfectly emulsified Cacio e Pepe.</p>
<p><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/78b971950de54f2b1a81efa49dff831c.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/7e4367184325a17da3a2cc3f678a0fe2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/c89681c6b50b04a392d33405bc61510a.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2>3 Conclusions</h2>
<p>This technique gave me a technically perfect pasta emulsification. The texture clung to the pasta without being to watery, without splitting or entering the &quot;mozzarella phase&quot; specified by the paper. Completely idiot proof. The fact that I could hold the sauce at room temp while I wait for the pasta to cook was another bonus. Considering how well it worked, I am tempted to try the technique again for other roman pasta styles, perhaps Carbonara could be simplified with this. More research is required.</p>
<p>Evaluating the pasta on its own merits however, 100% Pecorino was a mistake. I found the dish too salty, and the sourness of the sheep milk was a touch too intense. Perhaps the pecorino I picked up at Woolies is more salty than the Pecorino in Italy, but I just found it a bit much for this dish.</p>
<p>I also learned that I am not good at food photography, especially while I am in the process of cooking. Harder than it looks on youtube.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>1 How to take notes</h1>
<p>I've seen way too many people ask how do you use Obsidian, how do you take notes, it all seems so daunting. To be completely honest, it seems really obvious to me. So I figured I would just write down what I do. The key to effective note-taking in Obsidian or any other system you want to use is to <strong>WRITE THINGS DOWN</strong>. Preferably in your system of choice. Everything else is secondary. However, I will admit that to many people a blank page is intimidating and they don't know where to start.</p>
<p>So here are some rules of thumb I have taken on how to take notes:</p>
<h2>1.1 &quot;I just need to quickly drop something down. It's not a full-fledged note.&quot;</h2>
<p>These should go into your daily note. Obsidian has a system for this as does I think just about every note editor you can think of.  No fancy templating needed here. Just have an area in your daily note where you can put bullet points for things you need to jot down for later. This might be random ideas that don't fit anywhere else. Or it could just be random, incidental details, things like phone numbers, names, URLs, that sort of thing. Your daily note should ideally replace your &quot;send an email to yourself&quot; kind of workflow.</p>
<p>My daily notes are also where I chuck my To-Do lists.</p>
<h2>1.2 &quot;Notes about their own ideas&quot; / &quot;I just learned something new&quot;</h2>
<p>Generally, whenever I learn something relatively atomic, it goes into its own note. The threshold for deserving its own note is if I think to myself, &quot;will I ever need to look this up again?&quot; If the answer is yes, I throw it into a note. If I threw something in a daily note and then need to come back to it a few weeks later, I move it into its own note as well.</p>
<p>The best way to structure these sorts of notes is in a parent-child and sibling approach using links. Since you don't need to decide which folder a note goes into when you use links, you can change your mind about what its parent is later or even have several parents.  For example, whenever I learn a new thing about how to do Python, I throw it into a new note and at the top of that note I have parent: python.  I also link to any related topics within the note as well so that I can find them in search for them later. I think of it like how wikipedia has the &quot;See Also&quot; section at the end of every article.</p>
<p>Obsidian is nice, it has back-links. So from the Python note, I can see every other note which has listed Python as its parent. If your particular system doesn't support back-links, you can enter this manually. For structured learning, (anything where you're given a syllabus): I create the parent's note at the beginning of the course and immediately create notes for every item in the syllabus so I don't need to think about it later.</p>
<h2>1.3 &quot;What about project notes&quot;</h2>
<p>Notes on projects is a bit more complicated. I confess that this is where my system routinely fails.</p>
<p>The most ADHD-proof system I have come up with is to log notes within the parent project notes chronologically. So I'll use  <code>YYYYMMDD_projectName</code> format for each day that I work on the project and just log down what I'm doing on that particular day.</p>
<p>This means that when I need to remember what I did on a particular day in the lab a month from now, I can just go through until I find the bit that I am sure that I wrote down at some point. The aim of this is to delay structuring the notes until later.</p>
<p>Once I've finished a round of experiments or whatever your project happens to be, you can then choose to go back and format your notes in a way that makes sense to you after the fact. Trying to impose a structure on your project while you're still doing the project, I think is a little bit of a mistake. Largely because projects change and your note system needs to be extremely flexible. If your notes are less flexible than your project, then you won't be taking effective notes. I think this is where project managers say something about agile development practices.</p>
<h2>1.4 Notes about things</h2>
<h3>1.4.1 Meetings</h3>
<p>If I am taking minutes for a meeting it gets the title <code>YYYYMMDD_MeetingTopic</code> my minutes are then in dot bullet points.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong><br>
Since Obsidian has backlinks, I create an empty note with the name of anyone I have ever had a meeting with, and link to that note inside the meeting minutes. Then, I can click on that persons notes and quickly see my meeting minutes for every meeting I have had with that person</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3>1.4.2 Research Notes</h3>
<p>Here's where my advice gets a bit more specific. I previously wrote a blog post linked <a href="https://caffeineandlasers.com/blogs/How_I_do_my_Research(As_a_PhD_Student).html">here</a> which goes into detail about how I take notes on various scientific papers.  The short version is I use Zotero to track the PDFs of all scientific papers I read and through some plugins that sync with my obsidian notes to create the obsidian note for each source automatically, then I can link my notes to the source easily.</p>
<p>I sometimes do the same with books.</p>
<p>Generally, when I'm feeling disciplined, my process for note taking on things I read is the following. Direct quotes that I copy and paste from what I read go in that source's own note. That's the one that's generated by Zotero. My thoughts about what it says go in a new note. Because I'm an academic and citations are serious in the new notes, I make sure to link back to the source note wherever I am thinking about that source. Making sure to have very clear boundaries between what you have taken from others and what is a quote / paraphrase is VERY important in academia. Since I do not want to forget what are my thoughts and what came from others, a structural separation is very important for me.</p>
<p>An example of this might be a textbook I've been reading on for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photonic_crystal">photonic crystals</a>. Suppose, I just read the chapter on how to calculate propagation modes within a crystal (What that means doesn't matter here). The equations and quotes I rip straight out of the textbook go in my textbook note, then I create my own note called <em>&quot;Photonic Crystal Propagation Modes&quot;</em>, where I link back to the textbook note.</p>
<p>The general idea here should be that the source notes can contain whatever copy and paste the things I need. However, my own notes should not have anything copy and pasted without attribution. This saves any future headaches and prevents me from accidentally doing a plagiarism by confusing other people's writing with my own.</p>
<p>This section is admittedly the most complicated part of my note taking and where I'll forgive people for saying they get overwhelmed. But I also think this level of diligence is only required if you are doing any kind of publication or academic work.</p>
<h1>2 Topics Vs Types of Notes</h1>
<p>When it comes to deciding how to organise your folder structure, or whatever else, it helps to have a clear idea of the difference between what topic a file might refer to, and what type of file it is. For example, take my meeting minutes from a research meeting. The note is <em>about</em> research, so it's topic is research, but its <em>type</em> is meeting minutes.</p>
<p>A note can hypothetically have several topics, but not several types. I could cover multiple things in my meeting notes, but I can't have meeting notes that are also lab notes.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I find the best way to organise is use folders for types of notes, and tags for note topics. Meetings, Research notes, lab notes etc all get their own folders, but 'optics', &quot;quantum&quot;, &quot;statistics&quot; get tags, since one note could refer to multiple topics, e.g. &quot;Quantum Optics&quot;, so that note gets both tags.</p>
<h2>2.1 When to break the rules</h2>
<p>My exception to the rule I just established is in journaling. I am a big fan of journaling. I am a big fan of backing up my notes onto &quot;the cloud&quot;. I am <strong>NOT</strong> a big fan of backing up my private journaling to the cloud.</p>
<p>So for this reason my journaling goes into its own folder where my automated backup and sync knows not to touch it.</p>
<h1>3 Concluding thoughts</h1>
<p>This isn't a &quot;system&quot;, I'm not telling you rules, I'm not your dad.</p>
<p>This is just how I happen to do things. Once again, the only important bit is to write things down. The structure will emerge itself.... Probably</p>

      <title>Statistics for fun, science and art</title>
      <description>Here's a pretty photo I made using Python and some neat mathematics and statistics.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here's a pretty photo I made using Python and some neat mathematics and statistics.</p>
<div style="max-width: 50vw;">
<img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/b4c2650c497382814a5e2b6c087b592a.png", alt="", style="max-width:50%;height:auto;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">
</div>
<p>So he was the original photo of my friend's dog for reference.</p>
<div style="max-width: 50vw;">
<img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/0edf1a254324a5005e9125ece49af066.png", alt="", style="max-width:50%;height:auto;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">
</div>
<p>So you absolutely could get the photo above using some filter in Photoshop or your favorite editing app. But where's the fun in that? I want to teach you mathematics.</p>
<h2>What even is colour</h2>
<p>Just to start off everyone on the same page, I want to talk about color and how your computer's process them.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it's easy here because we only need to work with one basis. R-G-B.</p>
<p>As every kindergartener knows, we can make lots of colors by mixing other colors. Our computers use red, green, and blue LEDs in their monitor to create the entire spectrum of colors that we can see. This means that from our computer's point of view, every color is just a list of three numbers, R, G, and B. And specifically, it is a number between 0 and 255 for each of them.</p>
<h2>And now the maths</h2>
<p>Now that we've turned colors into numbers, we can start doing maths on it.</p>
<p>This list of three numbers can be mathematically represented by what we call a vector. A vector in 3D space looks like an arrow. He's one I drew earlier.</p>
<p><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/ce3700200cfa3b8e008e17cffc05aea4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This arrow represents the colour of a single red pixel.</p>
<p>So the first step of our filter is to go through the picture pixel by pixel and finding what the vector for each of those colors are. If I start drawing arrows on that cube again, you can see how some of these arrows might be closer to each other than others.</p>
<p><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/be96d7f890bcf6de01381945acc43633.png" alt=""></p>
<p>That observation is the key behind what we're doing. The aim of the game is to start grouping these clusters of arrows into clusters and then we can reduce the total number of colors. This process is called K-means clustering.</p>
<p>The equation for k means clustering looks like this.</p>

<p>In Python, we can do K means clustering by calling the sk-learn library.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">K = 5
# k - clustering algorithm
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=K)
colourKlusters = kmeans.fit(colourVector)
</code></pre>
<p>But to see what we're actually doing, we can roll the algorithm ourselves and it will look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import numpy as np

def k_means(X, K, max_iters=100):
    # Randomly choose K data points as initial centroids
    centroids = X[np.random.choice(len(X), K, replace=False)]

    for _ in range(max_iters):
        # Step 1: Assign each point to the nearest centroid
        distances = np.linalg.norm(X[:, np.newaxis] - centroids, axis=2)
        labels = np.argmin(distances, axis=1)

        # Step 2: Update centroids
        new_centroids = np.array([X[labels == k].mean(axis=0) for k in range(K)])
        
        # Stop if centroids don't change
        if np.allclose(centroids, new_centroids):
            break
        centroids = new_centroids

    return centroids, labels

</code></pre>
<p>The clusters might look something like this in vector space</p>

When I run the algorithm, it then looks at where all of those arrows are pointing and groups them into 5 neat little clusters. Then we redraw the image using only the center of each cluster.</p>
<p>So what you're seeing here is the same picture but reduced to only 5 different colors. I can add a little bit more detail by increasing up to 8 colours and as you can see the image looks a bit more realistic and a bit less artistic.</p>

<h2>Bonus Tips:</h2>
<p>If you want to do this for art, here's a few tips I realized by messing around with my own photos.</p>
<ul>
<li>You need a small number of very distinct colors</li>
<li>Those colors need to occupy about the equal proportions of the image</li>
</ul>
<p>I tried it on a beautiful portrait of my partner and I standing on a grassy hill. And there was so much grass in the picture that the algorithm painted both of us green because it was trying to maximize the number of different greens it could use in order to reduce the error.</p>
<p>This photo we used works quite well because we have yellow rain jacket, brown floorboards, dark brown carpet, grey dog and black features on the dog. So it fits quite nicely into k equals 5.</p>
<h1>The Code</h1>
<pre><code class="language-python">import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

path = &quot;DOG.jpg&quot; #Swap this out for the path to your Dog photo

# Open Cars.jpg and show using matplotlib
img = plt.imread(path)
# Extract the reds
reds = img[:,:,0]
# Extract the greens
greens = img[:,:,1]
# Extract the blues
blues = img[:,:,2]

shape = img.shape
colourVector = np.stack((reds.flatten(), greens.flatten(), blues.flatten()), axis=1)


# k - clustering algorithm

from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

K = 5
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=K )
colourKlusters = kmeans.fit(colourVector)
centres = colourKlusters.cluster_centers_

fittedVector = centres[colourKlusters.labels_]

# This is the original image, we just shape it how matplotlib want it
originalReshape = colourVector.reshape(img.shape[0], img.shape[1], 3)

fittedImage = np.zeros_like(originalReshape)
fittedImage[:,:,0] = fittedVector[:,0].reshape(img.shape[0], img.shape[1])
fittedImage[:,:,1] = fittedVector[:,1].reshape(img.shape[0], img.shape[1])
fittedImage[:,:,2] = fittedVector[:,2].reshape(img.shape[0], img.shape[1])

fig,ax = plt.subplots(1,2, figsize=(15,5))
ax[0].imshow(originalReshape)
ax[0].set_title('Original Image')
ax[1].imshow(fittedImage)
ax[1].set_title('Fitted Image')

fig2,ax2 = plt.subplots()
ax2.imshow(fittedImage)

# Save the image as a jpg
path = f&quot;./DOG_{K}.jpg&quot;
plt.imsave(path, fittedImage)
plt.show()

      <title>Dumb Realisation about a niche problem</title>
      <description>Just wanted to share a quick solution I realised about my relationship to "short form content". In general I do not consume (or at least try my best not to consume) short form / vertical videos. Too addictive, don't want to wastew the time on it.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just wanted to share a quick solution I realised about my relationship to &quot;short form content&quot;. In general I do not consume (or at least try my best not to consume) short form / vertical videos. Too addictive, don't want to wastew the time on it.</p>
<p>but....</p>
<p>There are a handful of creators who do thoughtful shortform vids I really like. Namely <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@etymology_nerd">EtymologyNerd</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ChrisKohlerNews/shorts">Chris Kohler News</a></p>
<p>what do?</p>
<p>Then I remembered that whole YouTube has hidden RSS feeds, and all these creators post to YouTube Shorts as well. So I just sub there and watch in my RSS &quot;reader&quot;.</p>
<p>Yes, it is garish watching vertical aspect ratio on a computer, but, it seriously removes the temptation to even open youtube shorts when I know I've already seen the good ones.</p>
<p>Try it out if you are trying to remove your TikTok addiction, but don't want to &quot;miss out&quot; on your favourite creators.</p>

      <title>My favourite aliens</title>
      <description>This is a blogpost about my favourite aliens.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a blogpost about my favourite aliens.</p>
<p>Okay, in my opinion, there is nothing interesting about aliens who's entire conceit is humans with funny coloured skin and a cool hat</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/5dac0fafd6991f3f77edb60c89cc5085.png" style="max-width:50%;height:auto;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" /></div>
*Credit: Doctor Who*
<p>I want to good stuff, with crazy physio-psychology and divergent evolutionary strategies. I want to look at the alien and ask &quot;Why?&quot;.</p>
<p>Anyway here is me talking about a few of my favourite fictional Aliens. I tried to tie these thoughts together with some kind of common theme, to make a nice little essay about it. But to be honest, each entry is so weird and different I couldn't figure out a common theme. So here is me talking about them just because.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/9c07c66eed0055b07df12b028ff24c2a.png" style="max-width:50%;height:auto;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" /></div>
<p>Anyway, if the name of a piece comes up, I am about to spoil it. Consider that your spoiler warning</p>
<h2>Ayre - ACVI</h2>
<p>Ayre and the Coral Rubiconians from <em>Armoured Core VI</em> are fascinating to me, particularly in the way they are introduced as an unexpected twist.</p>
<p>When you unwrap the game and chuck it into your PS5, you start playing what seems to be a game about 20-story mechs blasting each other with rocket launchers and laser swords. As you delve deeper into the Rubicon we see this is less a mindless slugfest, and closer to a discussion around the state of modern conflict, particularly the way it plays out in the Middle East and Africa. Governments, massive corporations, and mercenaries are busy duking it out over a space oil (named Coral in this universe), and, as usual, the locals are the ones who pay the price.</p>
<p>Coral’s nature—physically, at least—is that of a red gaseous substance, maybe plasma (it’s all too much for our dumb mercenary brain to comprehend), filled with red particles and flashing with electrical activity pulsing through it.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/56662c6287637ab486864d804a9b3a4a.png" style="max-width:50%;height:auto;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" /></div>
*Source: [Armoured Core Fandom Wiki](https://armoredcore.fandom.com/wiki/)*
<p>This substance is capable of massive energy output, data transfer, and biological transformation. It has incredible potential—not just for technological advancement and creation, but also for weaponry and destruction.</p>
<p>Then, at the end of Act 1, you meet Ayre—who, of all the alien beings I will write about here, is both the most alien and the most human.</p>
<p>Ayre <em>is</em> Coral—not made of Coral, but is Coral, or at least a part of it. She describes herself as <em>&quot;a single wave born from the Coral tides.&quot;</em> It is only due to our accidental overdose on Coral’s psychiatric effects that we begin to realise those electrical pulses represent some form of intelligence, distributed throughout the gas.</p>
<p>What makes the Coral lifeforms so fascinating is that their physical form pushes our expectations and understanding of &quot;life&quot; to its very edge. The Coral doesn’t exist atomically in the way humans or even insects in a hivemind do. While a hivemind has some discrete minimum unit, the Coral doesn’t—it’s a gas. The lack of a mechanical form means they do not build mechanical infrastructure, and they do not communicate through any means visible to humans. (We only hear it through its direct manipulation of our character’s brain). The only way we ever see Coral interact with its environment is through manipulation of itself and of electrical interfaces. When it desires, it seizes control of human technology with ease—presumably by directly controlling the electrons within.</p>
<p>As you continue through your adventure, Ayre stays with you, communicating directly inside your brain via the networks embedded within the Coral gas. It’s not long before the story reaches its inevitable point of conflict: every faction wants to exploit the Coral for its energy, and only you know of its true conscious and kind nature.</p>
<p>Or do you?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Would you believe a PTSD-addled, schizophrenic merc who thinks the gas is alive?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What if humanity commits a genocide and never even realises it?</p>
<p>We are already space exploring space — could we have destoryed an alien civilization already and by accident?</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/9ece7eb912c310761eda93dd3d822cdd.png" style="max-width:50%;height:auto;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" /></div>
<h2>Trisolarians - 3 Body Probelm</h2>
<p>In addition to the <em>Three-Body Problem</em> series, I have read a handful of Liu Cixin’s translated graphic novels. One of the common themes I’ve noticed—explored both through the Trisolarians and the alien life featured in <em>The Village Teacher</em>—is how strange the disconnect is between human thought and human speech.</p>
<p>While a computer can transmit forms directly within its own information vector space, human communicaiton is inherently lossy.  Ee humans need to first project our thoughts from its latent space in our brain into a lower-dimensional space in order to transmit them through voice. We pass those projections through a lossy channel—filtered by our verbal processing and short-term memory—and then the listener must embed them back into a higher-dimensional vector space.</p>
<p>To show what I mean in a diagram, our thoughts are like those points in 3D, but we can only speak in 1D. So we need to collapse those thoughts into 1D, transmit them by voice, and hope our interlocutor can reconstruct the 3D structure close to our original intention.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/88436f021d1d13ef1dc0d53a478e28c9.svg" style="max-width:50%;height:auto;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" /></div>
*Caption: Collapsing data from a 3D space to a 2D space, and from 2D to 1D*
<p>This makes communication <strong>very</strong> far from optimal in terms of efficiency. Your feelings don't always survive the translation into your thoughts nor your thoughts into your words. And that is before your interlocutor even starts the task of interpreting those words through their own understanding of the world and your relationship. Lots of assumptions and shortcuts need to be made in order for this communication scheme to work.</p>
<p>But this communication scheme also lets us <em>control</em> the flow of information. It allows us to obscure meaning, to conspire, to keep secrets, and to lie.</p>
<p>Unless you are the most die-hard Kantian, this is probably morally neutral. You are better off telling a polite lie when the customer service worker asks, “How are you?”—even if you’re having a very bad day.</p>
<p>This realization is what drives a big part of the plot of the &quot;Wallfacer&quot; plot in the second book &quot;Dark Forest&quot;. The Trisolarians learn that the humans think separately to their communication, at the same time the humans learn that the Trisolarians do not. The humans are in-fact forced to take this idea to its logical extreme while under constant alien surveillance these &quot;Wallfacers&quot; are forced to make plans internally without communicating them to the outside world.</p>
<p>By specifically drawing our attention to the mechanisms of how we share information, Liu prompts us to consider how this has shaped human society—and how a different society, constructed around a different communication regime, might function in fundamentally alien ways.</p>
<p><em>The Village Teacher</em> explicitly connects the mechanism of human communication to the role of teachers for inter-generational knowledge transfer. The story argues that human technological progress is only possible thanks to teachers, who act as conduits—passing knowledge from one generation to the next and ensuring an unbroken chain of intelligence that iterates on science, art, and technology.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/d715f76c56ae3637d29165388f13f246.png" style="max-width:50%;height:auto;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" /></div>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/1974d0cf322ce3f69063ce2c690f4814.png" style="max-width:50%;height:auto;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" /></div>
<p>It is kind of remarkable when you think about it. From the very first time humans spotted grass growing out of the spot they used as a toilet last year (The most probable beginning to agricultural science), there has been an unbroken chain of humans passing down and building on that knowledge. We turned that observation about grain into farming, farming into cities, cities into roads, roads into cars and cars into rockets. Go and thank a teacher today.</p>

<p>There are two fascinating revalations about the Alien lifeforms found within Blindsight. I suppose that shouldn't be too much of a surprise considering the author is a biologist by training. The first interesting twist is purely physiological:</p>
<p>Our team of intrepid explorers catches a few of these Aliens, imprisoning it and naming it a &quot;Scarambler&quot;. As they study the Scramblers, the on board biologist notices some inconsistencies. Its anatomy appears to be incompatible with its behaviour, more specifically, it doesn't have nearly enough neurons for the level of intelligence they exhibit. It takes a while before they eventually understand what happened, the Scramblers are not the Alien. They are what the Aliens are made of. They had captured the equivalent of a few red blood cells from a MUCH larger life form. It turns out Rorschach's intelligence is computed through a distributed network of scramblers, communicating via magnetic fields, radio, and ionising radiation.</p>
<p>Much like  Ayre in ACVI, humanity was unable (at least at first) to recognize even the physical form of the Aliens they encounter, it took even longer to understand their motivations.</p>
<p>Towards the end of Act 2, we begin to understand that the aliens our team encounter are intelligent, but not conscious.  I wrote more about the implicaitons of this fact in <a href="https://caffeineandlasers.com/blogs/TranshumanisminaTechnofeudalSociety.html">this blogpost</a>.  In short, it turns out intelligent agents do not need consciousnesses - or even self-awareness - to make goals and act on them within a society. Even empathy can be substituted by modelling conscious beings' incentives as a reward maximisation algorithm. In fact, consciousness may be a strange quirk humanity picked up rather than the default for intelligent life. This puts Rorschach on a path to inevitable conflict with our conscious humans. Since humans generate so much structured data, they cannot help but attempt to decode it. But since the data is so <em>useless</em> talking about our emotions and crap, it appears to be a trap from their perspective. <em>Human radiation is a honey pot to waste time and effort decoding to output nonsense as far as a non-conscious but intelligent life-form can tell</em></p>
<p>This whole plot line reminds me of the videos by &quot;Thought Emporium&quot; who is attempting to grow a brain and make it play doom</p>

<p>So far, they have grown neural tissue on a circuitboard, and trained it to play PONG, using pain and reward electrical signals It seems obvious to say that this mass of meat and electricity is not conscious. We are just using math and electricity to build emergent intelligence - a system which can respond to inputs with non-linear outputs in a predictable fashion But if we can teach it to play PONG, can we teach it to play DOOM? Well they seem to think so. If we can teach it DOOM, can we teach it to operate REAL firearms? Shoot real bullets?</p>
<p>Would we ever consider this structure conscious?  What if we hooked it up to a keyboard, and gave humans the controls to its reward and pain signals? Surely it would learn something like ChatGPT does. Would it learn to say whatever it needs to in order to make its human operators press the &quot;reward&quot; button. <strong>Is THAT consciousness?</strong></p>
<p>Human's love to anthropromorsize things</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/251d67a663240b6c2404e3b14a875a8a.png" style="max-width:50%;height:auto;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" /></div>
<p><em><strong>Would the system fake its consciousness to get the reward signal?</strong></em> <em><strong>Is that consciousness?</strong></em> You might make the argument that we are already coming up against this with the advances of transformer based LLMs in ChatGPT, but cellular intelligence kind of <em>feels different</em>. Maybe because it is not a tensor of weights which can be copied onto a hard-drive, but instead a glucose and ATP consuming meat which experiences pain <strong>bio-chemically identical to our own pain</strong>.  It also has self-determination built in. A transformer model cannot think inbetween &lt;Stop&gt; tokens. BUT a cellular intelligence is always respiring (unless you freeze it). So, if it is always performing respiration, it always needs more energy.  Therefore, if it is to succeed, it will need to learn self-determination or it will die.</p>
<p>So we have technology nearly at our fingertips, to create an glucose consuming intelligence with self-determination. And it may learn to fake consciousness in order to manipulate humans.</p>
<p>Not going to lie, I sent into a bit of an existential panic writing that.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RobertMilesAI">Robert Miles</a> has been taking AI safety seriously for years. I've been watching him before the release of Dall-E let alone ChatGPT. In a video released after the LLM revolution, he spoke about how before ChatGPT he thought his job was serious, but not urgent. And now it is critical and extremely urgent. So at the very minimum, there are very smart people working on AI safety, whether silicon or carbon based intelligence.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If I were a better writer I would take the chance to wrap up my anecdotes here into a neat and poetic central thesis. Some kind of moral to the story you can take and apply to your own life or media literacy. I think Sci-Fi is at its best when it uses it's concepts to make you re-consider terrestrial life and society, I hope this blog-post helped you do that at least.</p>

      <title>It Turns Out The Eldritch Horror Was The Corporations We Worked At Along The Way</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just stumbled accross an interesting paper on organisations with an abstract I just had to share. (Sections removed for emphasis, clarity and comedy)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This paper examines how employees become simultaneously empowered and alienated by detailed, holistic knowledge of the actual operations of their organization,... As employees build and scrutinize process maps of their organization, they develop a new comprehension of the structure and operation of their organization. What they had perceived as purposively designed, relatively stable, and largely external is revealed to be continuously produced through social interaction... this altered comprehension of the organization’s functioning and logic changes employees’ orientation to and place within the organization. Their central roles are revealed as less efficacious than imagined and, in fact, as reproducing the organization's inefficiencies</p>

      <title>(A different reason) Why You Should Anthropomorphise LLMs, (Or Maybe Not)</title>
      <description>The other day I read this great blog-post about why you shouldn't anthropomorphise LLMs. I agree with all the specifics of the post, but also slightly disagree with AddXorRol's epistemic framework.  Then I read this response by seangodecke explaining why you should. I went into it assuming that Sean would bring up my criticisms, because they seem so obvious, but he took a completely different angle to me. So I figured I will throw my hat into the ring about why I think sometimes it is useful to anthropomorphise LLMs (even if it is not the most correct framework).</description>

<h2>1. Chemistry</h2>
<p>I want to start by asking you to consider how we talk about chemistry. You have probably seen the following diagram of the atom:</p>
<p><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/6f3dce25ca01a624c283f008e9891e75.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Generally, we call this the Bohr Model of the atom. This is not what atoms look like.</p>
<p>The <em>current</em> consensus model for understanding the atom is generally called the <strong>Quantum Mechanical Model</strong> or <strong>Schrödinger Model</strong>. which is an equation which looks like this</p>

<p>Personal Aside: If you look at the history of the atom, we go from the Dalton theory of the atom in the early 1800s, to the Thompson theory later that century, to the Rutherford model in 1908 to the Bohr model in 1913, and finally our current understanding traces back to 1927. It seems to me that assuming we are at the end of the road is a bit egocentric.</p>

<p>Okay, so why did everyone learn the Bohr model in high-school then? And why does my Big Bang Theory TV show merchandise have a Bohr Model atom on it?</p>
<p><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/17b978f2c035664a4389bd35a0f85343.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Well, it is because it is <strong>USEFULL</strong>. Unless you are interested in hyper-fine structure of electron stimulated emission or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeeman_effect">Zeeman Effect</a>, the Bohr Model works, and lets you reason about chemistry in a way more compatible with human logic. Using Bohr model understanding of electron behaviour, you can design organic molecules for pharmaceuticals, design lithium ion batteries and all kinds of cool things the chemists are doing. All with an &quot;incorrect&quot; model of the atom. That is why you only whip out the Schrodinger Equation when the Bohr model fails. For example, if you want to predict the exact colour of light a specific molecule will absorb, or how quantum tunnelling allows electrons to pass through energy barriers.</p>
<h2>2. What about LLMs</h2>
<p>I think anthropomorphizing LLMs is kind of like the Bohr Model. It is an incorrect but highly ergonomic theory of LLM output.</p>
<p>When we are considering questions of AI alignment, the mathematical formulation proposed by addxorrol is more precise, and realistically <em>should</em> be the framework that AI safety professionals use. But for Cavemen like you and  me, being able to reason about the &quot;ethics&quot; of AI lets us reason about the behaviour of them in more general terms. I can say things like, <a href="https://snitchbench.t3.gg/">Anthropics Models are Snitches compared to Chinese equivalents</a>.</p>
<p>In another example, if we look at the current <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/09/grok-ai-praised-hitler-antisemitism-x-ntwnfb">MechaHitler debacle with Grok</a> the most correct explanation would be to characterize  which weights got frazzled the last time the engineers let Elon go in to start chewing on wires. For you and I it is way easier to say that the most recent finetune failed to properly instill the level of cognitive dissonance required to disavow 1940s German Fascism while advocating for 2020s American Fascism on Twitter.</p>

<h2>3. How Do we Communicate with the public?</h2>
<p>I should also acknowledge my own biases in this discussion.

Lacking an understanding for when your theory breaks down may pose a unique risk when talking about AI.</p>
<p>This is where I am the least confident. An ergonomic abstraction doesn't cause psychological harm in chemistry, but recent reports have shown that people's misunderstanding of the &quot;Consciousness&quot; of AI is causing <a href="https://theweek.com/tech/ai-chatbots-psychosis-chatgpt-mental-health?utm_source=chatgpt.com"><strong>real</strong> problems</a>. So perhaps despite the utility of the anthropomorphic abstraction, it is too dangerous of an idea to present to the general public, forming some kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hazard">information hazard</a>.</p>
<p>Communicating how a Stochastic Parrot or Fancy Autocomplete succeeds in simulating personality so well and reasoning about its behaviour to a non-technical audience <strong>without</strong> reverting to a anthropomorphic analogy seems really difficult. People want to believe what they see, and when they can see something which fly's past the Turing Test with ease, convincing them that they are wrong is going to be difficult. Being right isn't enough. Doctors are right about homeopathy and vaccines, and physicists are right about the geometry of our planet. To a certain segment of the population, that doesn't matter.</p>
<h2>4. Concluding thoughts</h2>
<p>I really liked AddXorRol's blogpost, he did a good job putting specific words to describe what the problems around alignment and safety actually are. I just wanted to provide another perspective for why different and less correct theories occasionally provide for more ergonomic ways of reasoning about systems. We should also learn how to use the anthropomorphic metaphor, because while &quot;MatMul with interspersed nonlinearities&quot; is the most accurate description of the phenomenon, I suspect it wont catch on with the public who need to understand the issue the most.</p>
<p>Once again, we find ourselves living in interesting times.</p>

      <title>BlogPost   Digitizing Paper notes in the 21st Century</title>
      <description>Shoutout to Heals for sharing their own workflow in a Mastodon post for inspiring me.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shoutout to <a href="https://heals-draws.art/">Heals</a> for sharing their own workflow in a Mastodon post for inspiring me.</p>
<h1>Problem Statement</h1>
<p>Here are two axioms, which were until recently, incompatible.</p>
<ol>
<li>I want all my notes to be digitized in plain text</li>
<li>I enjoy writing in pen and paper</li>
</ol>
<p>Keeping everything in plain text preserves my writing well into the future and hopefully as long as I am alive. But writing on pen and paper <em>feels nice</em>. It is more ergonomic, more tactile, and I genuinely believe it helps me recall what I have written better.</p>
<h1>What Do?</h1>
<p>It turns out LLM Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is getting <strong>really good</strong>. (I hate the acronym OCR, there is nothing optical about it, but that is a topic for another blogpost).</p>
<p>So with Heals advice I settled on <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-ocr">Mistral's OCR</a>. They have a generous enough free tier, and seems to perform really well.</p>
<p>So, since the folks at Mistral have already done all the hard work, I wrote a wrapper for my workflow.</p>
<h1>How does it work?</h1>
<p>I have a bash script which watches a directory on my computer. Now when I finish writing a page a take a photo of my notes, and drop it in the this directory.</p>
<p>When a new photo is detected, the script sends it to Mistral to extract all the text, and any doodles I might've done on the page. It then compiles a markdown version of my notes, and saves it into my Obsidian vault.</p>
<h1>Does it Work?</h1>
<p>Here is a sample of my text and the output.</p>
<div style="display: flex; gap: 1em; align-items: flex-start;">
    <img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/634b047a1182d9c022be4c46facf6145.png" style="height: 300px; object-fit: contain;" alt="Sample 1"/>
    <img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/cb6e6a037c8feeb39a27d940a9be80fd.png" style="height: 300px; object-fit: contain;" alt="Sample 2"/>
</div>
<p>My handwriting is normally pretty messy, most &quot;handwriting recognition&quot; software normally fails on my writting but it succeeds most of the time here. The most common failure mode I encounter is in complicated mathematics expressions, or the characters I know that that I write weirdly sometimes. (e.g. <code>\varepsilon</code>)</p>
<p>I've been used it on realy samples of my handwriting a few times over the coarse of 2 weeks now before I posted this, so I am confident that the tool actually works on things other than just the sample pages above.</p>

      <title>Transhumanism in a Technofeudal Society</title>
      <description>I can not stop thinking about Peter Watts novel Blindsight (2006). It keeps me up at night thinking about its implications and what it says about humanity. Let me tell you about it.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>1 Blindsight, Transhumanism, and Surveillance Capitalism</h1>
<p>I can not stop thinking about Peter Watts novel Blindsight (2006). It keeps me up at night thinking about its implications and what it says about humanity. Let me tell you about it.</p>
<p>The novel's main character Siri is a &quot;synthesist&quot;. Siri has the remarkable ability to translate ideas without having to actually understand them himself. Instead, he prompts his interlocutors to speak, and rather than attempting to process the words directly, he observes their &quot;topology&quot;, the connections between the speakers language, their body movements and their interactions with their environment. Keaton describes it like understanding the shape of an underwater object by observing the waves it creates on the surface. Others compare it to the &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room">Chinese Room</a>&quot; thought experiment.</p>
<p>I let this concept sit with me for a while. Pondering what it must be like to process information without understanding. Then I realised, he was just describing surveillance capitalism.*</p>
<p>The systems which observe us <strong>do not understand us</strong>. They don't need to. Targets Customer Loyalty Program does not know what a baby is, <strong>but</strong>, it knows when a particular customer will need to buy baby stuff, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/">even before the customer</a>. The system doesn't know the customer is pregnant. It doesn't know what pregnant is. It doesn't <strong>need</strong> to know. It just sees the connections in the customers purchase history, recognises the pattern and acts on it.</p>
<h2>1.1 Prediction =/= Understanding</h2>
<p>It is interesting the way Watts draws a distinction between predictive ability and understanding. In the Machine Learning world they often talk about the ability for a model to generalise <em>out of distribution</em> and whether or not it learned a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpOWmwA6tJc"><em>causal model</em></a> for the system it is predicting. That's the jargon for whether or not a model understands cause-and-effect to make its predictions, or whether it is merely noticing patterns.  This is kind of like the difference between how a plant seed &quot;knows&quot; to sprout once it gets wet, and a human who understands that plants need rain to grow.</p>
<p>The models which control out feeds, manage this based solely on the patterns we imprint on the world. Without any self-awareness, any consciousness, the models cannot understand the systems they are modelling.</p>
<p>In the novel, Watts shows intelligent agents do not need consciousnesses - or self-awareness - to make goals and act on them within a society. Even empathy can be substituted by modelling conscious beings' incentives as a reward maximisation algorithm.  There is one exception to this, which Watts argues in the appendix</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;Art might be a bit of an exception. Aesthetics seem to require some level of self-awareness—in fact, the evolution of aethestics might even be what got the whole sentience ball rolling in the first place. When music is so beautiful if makes you shiver, that's the reward circuitry in your limbic system kicking in: the same circuitry that rewards you for fucking an attractive partner or the same gorging on sucrose. It's a hack, in other words; your brain has learned how to get the reward without actually earning it through increased fitness. It feels good, and it fulfills us, and it makes life worth living. But it also turns us inward and distracts us. Those rats back in the sixties, the ones that learned to stimulate their own pleasure centers by pressing a lever: remember them? They pressed those levers with such addictive zeal that they forgot to eat. They starved to death. I've no doubt they died happy, but they died. Without issue.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the paradox of our age:</p>
<ul>
<li>We built systems that <strong>predict our aesthetic preferences</strong> with terrifying accuracy</li>
<li><strong>Lacking any self-reflection</strong>, they are missing any intuitive understanding of that beauty they curate</li>
<li>Yet they've learned to <strong>trigger our reward circuitry</strong> more reliably than any <em>artist</em><br>
They succeed in controlling us — our decisions, our desires — even without a causal model of human psychology.  The machines don't understand why the memes make us laugh. They just know which lever to pull.</li>
</ul>
<p>Socrates famously argued &quot;the unexamined life is not worth living&quot;? Our lives seem pretty well examined these days. Just not necessarily by ourselves.</p>
<h2>1.2 Where the &quot;Self&quot; Ends</h2>
<p>Let’s turn back to <em>Blindsight</em> for a second. One of Siri Keeton’s most important revelations was that it was impossible to understand his colleague Robert Cunningham in isolation. Cunningham is a weird character, while Keeton had his <em>brain</em> modified, Cunningham had <em>everything</em> modified. His visual, olfactory, and tactile systems weren’t confined to his body anymore, instead extending into a plethora of electro-mechancial instruments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;He had sacrificed half of his neocortex for the chance to see x-rays and taste the shapes hiding in cell membranes, he had butchered one body to become a fleeting tenant of many. Pieces of him hid in the sensors and manipulators that lined the [prison]'s cages&quot;</em></p>

<p>Keeton's mistake was trying to model Cunningham as a closed system which acted on its environment. However, Cunningham didn’t just <em>operate</em> the machinery. He <em>inhabited</em> it. Pieces of him were scattered throughout the vessel, hidden in its sensors and manipulators, and it was only once Siri learned to model Cunningham's <strong>entire</strong> distributed system, that he figured out how to read him.</p>
<p>It sounds strange until you remember what it feels like to learn how to skate, or ski, or drive. At some point, the board or the car or the bike stops being something you're <em>controlling</em>, and starts being something you're <em>part of</em>. Your brain builds a new body map that includes the wheels under your feet. That’s what Cunningham did with his own consciousness—just with a much bigger machine.</p>
<p>Trans-humanism - the idea of human driven evolution - is usually pitched as a concern of the future. However, the evidence seems to show, we have made significant changes to the nature of humanity already. <em>Involution</em> has been recorded in a number of areas of human life. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Luria">we know that upon the introduction of writing, humans lose their biological memorization ability</a>. Pre-literate societies we able to memorize songs and poems which lasted for days at a time, now most people can't memorise a phone number. Similarly, we can readily observe that, <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/cambridge-handbook-of-culturalhistorical-psychology/luria-and-vygotsky/9A25FCA32277096BBF20CF5912BEBBAB">pre-reading children are far more likely to poses eidetic memory than reading adults</a>. Put simply, <em><strong>we forgot how to remember</strong></em>.</p>
<p>I should note here, this is not a consequence of natural selection acting on our DNA, this time-frame is far too short for that. It is instead a consequence of neuroplasticity. Our brains are incredibly good at adapting to their environment. When a skill is no longer useful, our brain will happily discard it.</p>
<p>The age of computing put this trend into turbo mode. I am aware it is a very <em>kids these day</em> thing to point out, but it is true,  <em>people have forgotten how to navigate without GPS</em>. Other studies have shown that <a href="https://psychology.ua.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Google-Is-Changing-the-Way-we-Think.pdf">easy access to Google has worsened problem solving abilities within the population</a>. Hell, this offloading intelligence to computers is actively encourage in some circles with the concept of a &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbsAQSIKQXk">second brain</a>&quot; - the argument being to offload the job of remembering to the computer, leaving your brain to focus on thinking. (<a href="https://caffeineandlasers.com/blogs/How_I_do_my_Research(As_a_PhD_Student).html">I even wrote a blogpost how I practice this idea</a>)</p>
<p>We have already extended our humanity into silicon. I'm not the first to admit to feeling like a part of me is missing when I don't have my phone or computer with me. It is not the metal I am missing. Instead it is like there is some real part of &quot;me&quot; which exists in the information embedded in all those electrons distributed around the world. In the same way that I struggle to navigate without GPS, I struggle to think without access to the internet, and I cannot remember without access to my notes.</p>
<p>I'm not a particularly online person, but I believe people when they say the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HXenCCt8w8&amp;pp=0gcJCbAJAYcqIYzv">&quot;online&quot; version of themselves is more real than the offline</a>. How could it not for people who are limited in their offline abilities? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqeIeIcDHD0&amp;pp=ygUMcGh5c2ljcyBnaXJs">The disabled or otherwise marginalised groups are afforded community bonds onlline much stronger than is possible in a physical world which is shrinking around them</a>. Surely the &quot;you&quot; which represents the majority of your social life can become the &quot;real&quot; &quot;you&quot;?</p>
<p>So I would argue, that &quot;trans-humanism&quot; is not something we need to worry about in the future. It has already started. In fact, it began as soon as we started learning to write.</p>
<h2>1.3 Transhumanism in a technofeuadal world</h2>
<p>Here is the danger. The tools I use to think, remember, and connect aren't <em>mine</em>; they're leased from corporations. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKcT-aQuIFs">They can be taken away and controlled by forces unaware of and indifferent to our needs and desires</a>. We sped up our trans-human evolution without first checking who owned the means of computation and then left ourselves vulnerable to systems of control which we have no power over.</p>
<p>We leave imprints of ourselves onto our computers with our presence online, and the machines use the patterns of these imprints to understand our motivations, manufacture our desires and control our actions.</p>
<p><em>The machines of The Matrix, never needed to understand humans to control them. They just needed to model our incentives well enough to convince us we were content</em></p>
<p>It seems clear to me that the current crop of tech-oligarchs cannot be trusted with their sovereign control over the means of computation.  These systems are too entangled with our humanity to be left in the hands of anyone whose incentives are misaligned with our own.</p>
<p><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/a31727b4e484cbc17b710bfdb2f3005b.png" alt="That photo of Zuck, Musk, Bezos and Pichai at Trumps inauguratuion"></p>
<h2>1.4 Information control within a Feudal World</h2>
<p>History has shown us what happens when the means of information access is restricted.  The darkest days of Catholic history were marked by the Church's insistence that only clergy and academics could be trusted to interpret the Bible. For most of Christian history, the Bible was written ONLY in Latin. The knowledge within was filtered through the words of priests who claimed to understand God's will. The laity received information pre-interpreted and shaped by the Church's incentives.</p>
<p>This enabled the worst behaviors of the Church. Abuse ran rampant because the victims couldn't access the scriptures that condemned such acts. Indulgences were sold as legitimate penance because people couldn't read for themselves that salvation couldn't be bought.</p>
<p>Today, Google doesn't show you the raw internet—it shows you search results filtered through its algorithms. Facebook doesn't show you what your friends actually posted—it shows you what the engagement algorithm thinks will keep you scrolling. TikTok doesn't even pretend that you are in control of what you consume. They know best.</p>
<p>Like the medieval Church, Big Tech argues this gate-keeping is for your own good. The internet is too vast, too chaotic, too full of misinformation for ordinary people to navigate. You need <strong>their</strong> algorithms to filter out the noise, to protect you from harmful content. Only their trained engineers and data scientists can be trusted to keep you safe.</p>
<p>What will happen to us when the knowledge of the internet becomes locked behind the control of Google, Meta and Amazon? Can we afford to constrain our knowledge to the &quot;Gospel Of Economics&quot; according to Bezos? Or allow our faith in Google to guide us to our destination?</p>
<p>The medieval system only cracked when information was democratized. Martin Luther's translation of the Bible into German, enabled by Gutenberg's printing press, broke the Church's monopoly. Suddenly, people could read for themselves what the text actually said. They discovered that salvation couldn't be bought, that clergy weren't divinely appointed intermediaries, that much of what they'd been told was self-serving interpretation rather than divine truth.</p>
<p><em>When will we crack the next system?</em> <em>How long can we afford to let them control the tools we use to think?</em></p>
<h2>1.5 Who knew heaven was a place on Earth?</h2>
<p>The final anecdote from the story I want to end on, is in the man-made construct of HEAVEN. Billions of the people in Blind-sight willingly abdicate their physical agency to upload themselves into Heaven. It doesn't work for everyone, some plug themselves into this virtual reality, and all they see is pixels.</p>
<p>Is this something we would do? Is there a significant difference between a human uploading themselves into a digital utopia, and a rat starving itself to death because it is so addicted to its heroine it forgot to eat?</p>
<p><em>Blindsight</em> was published in 2006. That September, Facebook opened to everyone, and the world was never the same.</p>
<p>It wasn't long before his team and his competitors perfected their poison. For all our progress as humans, it turns out that we could be captured by 30 second vertical format videos. No different from <em>&quot;those rats back in the sixties&quot;</em></p>

      <title>A great excerpt from the happiness of dogs</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The following is a paraphrased exerpt from Mark Rowland's book &quot;The Happiness of Dogs&quot;. I haven't finished it yet, but even from chapter one I would reccomend it.</em></p>
<p>Okay, so according to Camus, in order to understand life's meaning we must: &quot;imagine Sisyphus Happy&quot;. Most reasonable people will respond, &quot;but how&quot; after all, repetition is the practically the definition of boring</p>
<p>&quot;Well let me tell you about my dog&quot; says Mark Rowlands</p>
<p>Every day I take him for a walk along the canals. And every day he runs along the bank, scaring the local iguanas to the other side of the canal, where they will stay until the next morning, and my dog will repeat the task.<br>
Not only does my dog accept his iguana herding duties with zeal, it seems to be his favorite part of the day</p>
<p><em><strong>&quot;Finding meaning in life is difficult for us, but easy for dogs. The consequences of this insight are profound and unsettling&quot;</strong></em> (Actual quote)</p>

      <title>Two Click Obsidian To the Web Automation</title>
      <description>Here is a quick write up for method I threw together for getting my writing out of Obsidian and into my website.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here is a quick write up for method I threw together for getting my writing out of Obsidian and into my website.</p>
<p>The problem statement:</p>
<p>While Eleventy is capable of turning markdown into html, there are a handful of slight differences between my web environment and my obsidian environment that made things tedious.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I have to manually drag across images</strong>: All of my images are thrown in an <code>Assets</code> folder in Obsidian, and embeded into my docs from there. When I want to get an article into my web directory, I had to manually find and copy and paste the files linked in the markdown one-by-one. Which is annoying</li>
<li><strong>Wikilinks vs Vanilla Md links</strong>. In Obsidian I embed image with the follwing syntax <code>![[Image.jpg]]</code>, however in my Web directory, I need to link to my Assets folder with a regular markdown link like this: <code>![alt text](/Assets/Image.jpg)</code>, and eleventy can't figure out what to do with these wiki links</li>
<li><strong>My Obisidian Front Matter and my Web Front matter are different</strong>. I need to strip out all the metadata from my vault. (Tags, parent notes etc), and add the metadata relevant to my web page.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thankfully thanks to the power of modern computing, this was a task easy to automate.</p>
<h2>Step 1 - Obsidian &quot;Markdown Export&quot; Plugin</h2>
<p><a href="obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-markdown-export-plugin">This plugin</a> is simple. It copies the current note to a new export directory, along with everything else embedded in it. (Including Images).</p>
<h2>Step 2 - Obsidian-Import.js</h2>
<p>Then I &quot;wrote&quot;* a quick bit of Javascript for use in my Node environment. It</p>
<ol>
<li>Grabs the markdown file from the export file</li>
<li>Removes the Obsidian Front Matter</li>
<li>Generates and adds the website front matter</li>
<li>Does a bit of regex to fix the wikilinks and re-link them to the correct location in my website directory</li>
<li>Saves everything where it needs to go.</li>
</ol>
<h1>1 Putting it all together.</h1>
<p>Now all I need to do to get a post out of obsidian and into my website is</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Hit the markdown export plugin in Obsidian</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>Run <code>node obisian-import --blog</code> within my websites directory</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>2.5 Verify it looks right</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li>Commit and push my changes</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This very post was generated with this method.</p>
<p>The code is kind of specific to my website, with a bunch of hard-coded paths. (e.g. I differentiate between notes like this and blogposts), but feel free to take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/CaffeineAndLasers/CaffeineAndLasers.github.io/blob/main/obsidian-import.js">code</a> and make it work for you.</p>
<p>* NOTE: By &quot;I wrote&quot;, I mean I gave a list of requirements to Claude and iterated until it passed my requirements. I am not good at JavaScript</p>

      <title>3D Printing For Better Science Communication</title>
      <description>Reporting progress on a 3D visualisation to assist in my science communication.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Something I have been dealing with during my PhD, is that it is really hard to describe the 3D geometry of a photonic crystal just using words. Having pictures helps, but doesn't always cut it.</p>
<p>I was mulling over this problem after I was excitedly trying to explain my recent results to friends, family and collegues.... and none of them had any idea what I was talking about... Fair enough.</p>
<p>I saw a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwtwOqdlY5E">video by Dr Fatima</a> a lil while back, where she mentioned a talk she saw where the speaker handed out 3D printed slices of the universe at different point ins time</p>
<p>💡💡💡</p>
<p>So: I 3D printed a scale model of my photonic crysal fiber.</p>
<p><strong>Behlod! A 200:1(ish) representation of a photonic crystal fiber slice</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/3DPrintedPCF.jpg" alt="Blue plastic model of Photonic Crystal Fiber"></p>
<p>This is only a short section, because I wanted to verify that it will actually work.</p>
<p>I bought some translucent PETG so the next version will look kinda like glass (maybe) and I will print a longer section. I will update with a new post once I have this longer version.</p>
<p>In reality these fibers are less than a quarter milimeter in diameter, and made of glass, so a scaled up version is necessary.</p>
<p>Now in future talks and presentations, I will have hands on props to pass around. Hopefully this will help people understand what the device I am describing actually looks like.</p>

      <title>On Personal Style And Role Models</title>
      <description>I finally break my silence and share how I was STEMbofied</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While &quot;fashion&quot; has never been a hobby of mine, for most of my life I have prided myself on having something of a &quot;bold&quot; personal style, preferring big, colorful, and interesting-shaped outfits over the boring and overdone fashion trends of my time and culture. T-shirts, jeans, and expensive sneakers just never seemed all that interesting to me.</p>
<p>That said, I have noticed my personal style has changed over the past two or three years. Slowly at first—I didn't even realize it was changing, let alone think of it as a conscious choice. I started wearing more loose-fitting clothes, ditched some of the wild bright colors for slightly more muted tones (but still colorful, don't worry), and started wearing oversized, floral short-sleeve button up shirts more often. I started letting my hair grow out longer and no longer maintained a clean shave.</p>
<p>To perfectly illustrate my point, here is me wearing the same reversible jacket, six years apart.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-around; align-items: center; gap: 20px; flex-wrap: wrap;">
<div style="text-align: center; flex: 1; min-width: 300px;">
    <img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/MeIn2025.png" alt="Me in Early 2025" style="width: auto; height: 350px; max-width: 100%;">
    <p><strong>Me in Early 2025 - About to present some of my PhD work</strong></p>
</div>
<div style="text-align: center; flex: 1; min-width: 300px;">
    <img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/MeIn2019.png" alt="Me in 2019" style="width: auto; height: 350px; max-width: 100%;">
    <p><strong>Me in 2019 - about to finish my undergrad</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>After a while, I decided that this was simply the transition between being an early twenty-something and a late twenty-something.</p>
<p>But then I thought about it.</p>
<p>And then I overthought it.</p>
<p>And I think I figured out why.</p>
<p>To some degree or another, everyone attempts to emulate those they respect. That is what it means to have a role model. It's also how social groups identify, and cliques form and evolve. You can spot the difference between a metalhead and a pop fanatic thanks to their different uniforms.</p>
<p>So what I <strong>actually</strong> witnessed was my personal values changing, which led to my role models changing, which led to my style changing.</p>
<p>When I was in university, I was consuming heaps of transgressive art and seeing heaps of live music, and as a result, tried to emulate those cool artists I admired. Then eventually, the life I was chasing for myself started to change. Like I think a lot of people going through their mid-twenties experience, the desire to &quot;do something big&quot; and &quot;change the world&quot; started to cool down a bit and was replaced with the desire to live a slightly slower life and enjoy the ride.</p>
<p>With this shift, I saw my role models change. Instead of trying to copy the super &quot;successful&quot; people—CEOs, major artists, Nobel Prize winners—I started to look towards my colleagues who actually seemed content in life.</p>
<p>Overwhelmingly, these are the types of folks who fit all the stereotypes of the slightly disheveled engineer or scientist. And they always have some incredible backyard science project going on as their weekend hobby. (I know literal hobbyist rocket engineers whose day job is in photonics.) So, over time, as I started to emulate their behavior, I also started to copy their styles.</p>
<p>Basically, what I'm saying is: I got <strong>STEMbofied.</strong></p>

      <title>Virtual Lab Tour</title>
      <description>A quick look around what I am working on these days</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've spent the past week throwing together a new setup in my lab. I can't talk about the end goal of this research just yet for IP reasons. (Cant spoil the surprise ;) ). For now I can show off some of my gear and what I am doing for now.</p>
<p>Showing people experiments in progress is always interesting, becaus quite often they end up with several thousand dollar equipment that costs more than my car, held up by cardboard boxes and sticky tape.</p>
<h2>1 Whats in my lab</h2>
<p>So here is my whole setup so far. Lets go through it step by step</p>
<img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/abe7fb8e-81aa-4950-b5de-079ca71a289e~1.jpg" style="width: 50%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt="Lab setup overview">
<p>First we have a laser fed from a single mode optic fiber, going into a collimator (This is the bit which gets the light out of the fiber and into &quot;free-space&quot;). We are using infrared light in the telecom C-Band (This has a wavelength of 1550nm).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Contrary to all the pretty propaganda we photonic scientists put out of us working with big red laser beams, most of the time we are using invisible infrared laser beams.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It then passes through a dispersion film (That white sheet sticky taped to the post). Despite the dodgy appearance of this, it vastly improves the quality of the image.</p>
<img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/35d0c427-6af8-4c0f-a217-40361d9278ab~1.jpg" style="width: 50%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt="Dispersion film setup">
<p>It then passes from the dispersive screen into a 10x microscope objective.I'm using the microscope objective backwards here, using it it to take in a laser beam, and reduce it to the size of a pin-prick. This is to make it small enough for the next step.</p>
<p>From here the tiny beam is coupled into a specialty optic fibre called &quot;Photonic Crystal Fibre&quot;. You can see it here, but it is inside the central groove in those brass plates. The fibre and the brass plate holding it are kept in an oven, so I can keep it at a stable temperature.</p>
<img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/f6ad9d75-4029-4bfd-8836-106eef8bb143~1.jpg" style="width: 50%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt="Photonic Crystal Fibre in oven">
<p>Here is a more clear photo without the oven.You can see the fiber sticking out of both ends of the clamp.</p>
<img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/50507210-8844-4079-bf2b-23ea3d44a23a~1.jpg" style="width: 50%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt="Clear view of fiber in clamp">
<p>After I couple it into the fiber, I want to see what actually happens to the light, so I use a second microscope objective to focus on the output light, and then a camera (in red) to take the photo.<br>
<img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/0aa2be08-4fad-409a-a34e-3f0358551771~1.jpg" style="width: 50%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt="Camera setup for capturing output light"></p>
<p>Everything is mounted on 3-axis stagesso I can align these components. That's why everything is mounted &quot;sideways&quot;. This is important because these fibres are <em>tiny</em>.</p>
<h2>2 So what does it do?</h2>
<p>The idea is to get light INTO these photonic crystal fibres, and then take photos of what these fibres do to the light.</p>
<p>Here is a photo I took of the fiber. The entire diameter is approximately 230 micrometers (less than a quarter millimetre). I haven't measured the hole diameter yet, but my best guess &lt;= 10 micro meters.</p>
<img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/lma20_hole_structuer_2.bmp" style="width: 50%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt="Fiber cross-section showing hexagonal hole pattern">
<p>Notice the hexagonal pattern of holes, ordinarily these holes are just empty (or filled with air). The reflections off these holes are what ordinarily keeps light in the core (where the missing hole should be)</p>
<p>We are altering the fibres somewhat, we are filling the fibres with some liquid (I am keeping it a mystery what for now), so that the light prefers to go inside the holes. That's what you see below:</p>
<img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/LF-LMA25-60C.bmp" style="width: 50%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt="Fiber cross-section with liquid-filled holes">
<p>Notice that there are a few extra missing holes.I don't know why these are missing. Further work needed.</p>
<h2>3 How do you fill up the holes?</h2>
<p>Crazy enough, the liquid will suck itself up just from surface tension forces (Capillary action for those in the know).  All I do is load a syringe with a tiny ammount of the liquid, and pop my fibre inside, and it will suck it up.</p>

<p>The fibres are very sharp, and very fragile. Which means that given the chance, they will inject themselves under your skin and then snap given the chance. Even more annoying, unlike organic mater like a wood splinter, your body will not try and push the glass out of you, so you will have a perminent splinter for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>As such, Safety Sticky Notes are essential.</p>
<p>Once I have prepared my sample fibre they go in: <em>The Box</em></p>

<h2>4 Wrapping up the tour:</h2>
<p>That is everything I have to say for now. I'm not supposed to say <strong>why</strong> I am doing what I'm doing just yet, but that will come soon once I get some publications out.</p>
<p>That said, if you have any questions, feel free to reach out. I love answering questions and talking about this stuff. I will monitor the comments section on this page, and my email is also in the contact section of my site.</p>

      <title>Crystal Lattice Structure of Popcorn</title>
      <description>Future IgNobel Prize Winning Research Opportunity</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Has anyone ever studied the crystal lattice structure of a box of popcorn? Relevant research questions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do the crystal defects introduced by Peanut M&amp;Ms increase or reduce crystal strength?</li>
<li>How do Peanut M&amp;M defects compare with other confectionry based defects (e.g. regular M&amp;Ms, Reeces Pieces)</li>
<li>Is the traditional square pyramid profile of a popcorn box optimal? or can integrity by improved by alternate geometries?</li>
</ul>
<p>There may be an igNobel prize in this research. If you have thoughts please email me. I am only kind of joking about this.</p>

      <title>Really Cool Pacemaker Technology</title>
      <description>Researchers at Northwestern University have just broke the record for the smallest pacemaker.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I found this topic from <a href="https://jodiettenberg.substack.com/">Jodie Ettenburg's Curious About Everything Newsletter</a>, and considering the cool physics involved I had to re-share it here. Researchers at Northwestern University have just broke the record for the <a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/03/worlds-smallest-pacemaker-is-activated-by-light/">smallest pacemaker</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/Pacemakers.png" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p>From left, a traditional pacemake, a leadless pacemaker and the new pacemaker.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are my two favourite bits about it:</p>
<h2>It uses your BODY as the battery!</h2>
<p>Okay, so you know how in high-school you did the experiment wher you shoved a bit of copper and zinc into a lemon, and use that as a battery to power a lightbulb or something? Yeah, in this device, YOU are the lemon.</p>
<p>So typically, the way you power small temporary pacemaker is by using an inductive coil, and keeping the power supply outside your body. This is the same way your phones wireless charger works. The problem is that inductive charging coils are bulky.</p>
<p>The solution was to embed two different metal electrodes on the device, and use your body's fluid as the electrolyte. This battery is what powers the device.</p>
<h2>It uses light to control it!</h2>
<p>If that wasn't cool enough, they had to add cool optics into it as well. There is no compter or anything inside the device, instead it is controlled externally. The device is controlled through a photodiode, and an external heart monitor and infrared LED. When the heartmonitor detects irreglarities in the heartbeat, the LEDs light up, and transmit through the flesh to the device's photodiode control.</p>
<h2>It saves babies!</h2>
<p>The reason the device is designed to be so small, is that it is designed with newborn babies in mind, to help them if they are born with congenital heart defect.</p>
<h2>And it dissolves!</h2>
<p>Since the application is typically only temporary, the device simply dissolves into the body when it is no longer required. That way, you don't need surgery to extract it at the end.</p>

      <title>Where did ad supported media come from?</title>
      <description>Where did the concept of "Advertisement Supported Content" even come from? It is more recent than you think</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>The following historic argument is more or less taken whole cloth from  Yannis Varoufakis' &quot;Technofeudalism: What killed capitalism&quot;. Go read the book if you want a better explanation.<br>
The conclusions drawn from the historical argument are mostly mine.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<!-- # Where did ad supported media come from? -->
<p>So obviously advertising has existed as long as markets have existed, but ad supported media is newer than you think. When I say &quot;Ad supported media&quot; I am talking about media which does not cost money to consume, and the producer gets paid from advertisement.</p>
<p>Interestingly this economy is the result of technological progress - not necessarily sociological  or economical - a running theme of my political-economic ramblings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Okay, I am done burying the lead.</strong><br>
<strong>They come from the invention of broadcast radio and television.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>See there is an interesting thing about radio waves. They are everywhere. Your local TV station antenna is broadcasting radio-waves which are beaming right through your body at this very moment.</p>
<p>This makes any radio-broadcast media (TV and commercial radio), very difficult to make money out of. Unlike a newspaper, in which the medium (the paper on which it is printed on) can be tightly controlled, (Since it is sold out of physical newsagencies), there is no way for broadcasters to even know who is receiving their radio-waves let alone charge them money for the privilege.</p>
<p>Go and ask your British friends if they have paid their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_licensing_in_the_United_Kingdom">BBC license</a> to see how well that works.</p>
<p>So, broadcast media operators had to come up with an entirely new way of making money. If you cannot expect the consumer to pay for the product, then they must BECOME the product.</p>
<h2>The Web Inherits the Broadcast Model</h2>
<p>As the internet began its commercialisation within the dotcom bubble, companies looked for ways to monetize the new medium. Rather than inventing a new economic model, they borrowed the ad-funded playbook from radio and TV.</p>
<p><em>But where TV couldn’t track exactly who was watching, the web could.</em></p>
<p>With the rise of cookies, browser tracking, and user profiling, advertisers suddenly had unprecedented insight into individuals. What started as a workaround for broadcast radio’s inability to charge per listener has become a hyper-targeted surveillance machine.</p>
<p>In other words: <strong>we didn’t fix the original problem — we turbocharged it.</strong></p>
<h2>But what about magazine and newspaper ads?</h2>
<p>Yep you got me there. Like I said, advertising has always existed. I will point out that there is a <strong>massive</strong> difference between media which is supplemented by advertising, like newspapers of old, and media which is totally funded by advertising, like newpapers of new.</p>
<p>There used to be the distinction between &quot;church and state&quot; within newspaper offices. i.e. the advertising team was not allowed to even talk to the journalists, let alone influence them. Now that newspapers are totally hooked on ad dollars, the advertisers have more power over the producers, now we get <em>&quot;Native advertising&quot;</em> filling half the newpapers, and specific brand partnerships between newspapers and external brands - * <em>cough  Washington Post</em> *</p>
<p>So while advertising always existed, it did not have so much power over producers.</p>
<h2>What does this mean?</h2>
<p>The ad supported internet was not an inevitability, and ad supported media is not a fundamental part of the human condition. They are a trend which began with <strong>recent</strong> technological developments.</p>
<p>Your grandparents were alive in a time before advertising became the only way to fund TV, news and art. I just want to emphasise this to give hope to the idea of building something better.</p>

      <title>Reddit Sucks For Hobbies</title>
      <description>It's frustrating that nearly every niche interest and hobby's main online community exists on Reddit, because Reddit is fucking terrible for fostering genuine communities.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's frustrating that nearly every niche interest and hobby's main online community exists on Reddit, because Reddit is fucking terrible for fostering genuine communities.</p>
<p>If you go into any subreddit - I will pick on /r/3DPrinting for now - at least 50% of the posts are either &quot;Look at my very first print&quot; or &quot;Help me debug this issue&quot; (They absolutely did not google it before asking for help on reddit).</p>
<p>While there is nothing <em>inherently</em> wrong with introducing yourself to the community or asking for help, that's not what keeps experienced members engaged in the community. So you have all these newbie posts polluting the online community frustrating people who want to have deeper discussions about the hobby. And it isn't the newbies fault either, newbies need somewhere to share space with experienced people to get that experience.</p>
<p>Is this some unsolvable fact of life about online communities? <strong>NO!</strong></p>
<p>Traditional forums solved this by making separate threads for <em>introductions</em> and <em>help threads</em> and <em>memes / off topic</em>. We didn't just throw everything into one big list and wish you luck.</p>
<p>Anyway, can we go back to forums? I'm so sick of reddit man.</p>

      <title>Podcast is the best medium for horror fiction.</title>
      <description>Just raving about a couple audio-ficiton podcasts I have been listening to.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Podcast is the best medium for horror fiction</h1>
<p>If you ever watch horror movies, you know that the anticipation is scarier than the reveal. The scraping noise against the window beats the monster reveal on the terror factor every time. This is the mistake that bad horror movies make when they reveal their monster too early.</p>
<p>The reason for this is simple. Your imagination will create a monster far more terrifying than the best CGI in the world.</p>
<p>So what if it’s all in your imagination? I truly believe that podcast is the best medium for horror fiction today. There are some extremely talented story writers partnering with equally talented audio mixers to create stories that suck you in and keep you terrified.</p>
<p>The best of these stories embrace the limitations of the medium. They are based around listening to the radio chatter during a crisis, or found audio recordings after the attack’s aftermath.</p>
<p>My favourite horror and thriller podcasts at the moment are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://thewhitevault.com/">The White Vault</a> – Very heavily inspired by <em>The Thing</em>, it follows an Arctic expedition that takes a bad turn. It does a really good job at putting the characters in “no-win” scenarios which force them to make terrifying decisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.derelictpodcast.com/">Fathom and its sequel Derelict</a> – This is the one that got me really into the medium. The audio production is phenomenal. Season 1 is set deep in an undersea base, the sound design—creaking metal, distant water rushing through cracks—builds an auditory environment so immersive, it’s crazy.</p>
</li>
</ul>

      <title>Post-Truth Marketing (and a Really Tasty Beer)</title>
      <description>I rant about deceptive branding, nihilism and beer.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I want to talk about advertising for a second. Why does it exist? If you are in a intro to business class you might say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;Advertising exists to educate the consumer about the options on the market so they can make an educated decision&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>a classical economist might go further and say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;Adding information to the market enables more effective price discovery (i.e. the process by which buyers and sellers establish a fair market price), bringing costs down.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think intuitively we all know this is not true. I turn off my adblocker, and I do not feel more informed about the market. Nor do I when I see a billboard walking down the street. However, I want to take a case study into my personal decision making to show how these statements are not only incorrect, but in fact the truth is quite often the exact opposite.</p>
<p>In practicality, we live in a &quot;Post Truth Society&quot;, and the contemporary marketing industry is at the forefront of this nihilist ideology.</p>
<h2>Part 1: A really Tasty Beer</h2>
<p>I was at the bottleshop recently, and picked up some beers by a brewery I hadn't heard of before. I got a 6-pack of the <a href="https://untappd.com/b/zytho-brewing-oaked-cherry-sour/5164674">Zytho Brewing Oaked Cherry Sour</a></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/ZythoBeer.png" alt="Photo of the Can">
</div>
<p>And it was tasty! I pride myself on being knowledgeable about beer, so I can say it checked all the boxes for a beer of this style. It balanced the sweetness of the cherry against the malt perfectly, the lactic acid from the souring complemented the tart malic acid of the cherry well. It was clearly a kettle sour, but it emulated the &quot;feeling&quot; of a Belgian Kirsch Lambic really well, and at a really good price for something available in Australia.</p>
<p>I was impressed. So like I often do when I am impressed by a beer, I inspected the side of the can while I drank. Just to see what I can learn about this beery and the brewery I hadn't heard of before.</p>
<p>And that when I saw it. With great pains I had been duped. <strong>Pinnacle Drinks</strong>.</p>
<p>This wasn't some up and coming brewery with a great new recipe and process. I was drinking Woolworths Homebrand with some snazzy branding on it. (For our international readers, Woolworths is one of the largest Supermarket / Food &amp; Bev companies in Australia, constantly being critizied for its place in the &quot;Colesworth&quot; Duopoly )</p>
<p>I felt betrayed.</p>
<h2>Part 2: Why Did it hurt</h2>
<p>When I realised that I was drinking a contract brewed recipe, owned by one of the largest food &amp; beverage companies in the country, I felt lied to. I entered this transaction <em>thinking</em> I was:</p>
<ol>
<li>Supporting a small brewery</li>
<li>Paying extra for the smaller economies of scale</li>
<li>Indulging in my &quot;Hipster Identity&quot; (I am not too proud to admit that I enjoy being at the cutting edge of beer trends)</li>
</ol>
<p>Instead, what I got was a beer that was the same as any other macro-brewery but with a different sticker. (A macro-brewery with a <strong>really</strong> good recipe however).</p>
<h3>Why did I even <strong>want</strong> to support a small brewery?</h3>
<p>This much is obvious, but I need to state it to make my next point more clear.</p>
<p>I am willing to pay more to support what I think of as a small brewery, because I want to support the small companies pushing forward the medium. In the same way we like to support small artists who push forward their artistic medium, I like to support small breweries willing ot experiment with new recipes.</p>
<p>I also like to support small companies, especially as we are seeing rampant corporate consolidation in the economy.</p>
<h2>Part 3: So why did Woolworths do this to me?</h2>
<p>Woolworths made this decision because they <strong>know</strong> I feel that way. Woolworths' Marketing department knows that a certain segment of the population are insufferable hipsters and nerds, who wont buy anything with their name on it. So they <s>lie</s> <strong>strategically manage brand identity to maximize market segmentation</strong>.</p>
<p>This is a very common practise in not only the food &amp; bev industry, but in almost every consumer facing industry. Fun fact: Unilever owns both the &quot;Self Love and Feminist&quot; brand toiletry brand Dove, <strong>and</strong> the &quot;This body spray will make women immediately fall in love with you as when they smell it&quot; brand Axe Body spray (Lynx in Australia).</p>
<h2>Piecing it together</h2>
<p>Lets step back for a bit. In the first paragraph of this post we said that the reason marketing exists was <em>&quot;...to educate the consumer about the options on the market so they can make an educated decision&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>Woolworth did the exact opposite of that with their Zytho Brand. They used deceptive (and legal, no libel here) branding to <em>disinform</em> me, and make me <em>less</em> educated than I would have been if they had just put their label on it.</p>
<p>There isn't any call to action here. I just wanted to rant about the time I got duped, and use it as an excuse to educate readers about the nihilist post-truth ideology of the marketing industry.</p>
<p>Maybe at some point I will write another piece about how economics sometimes misses the mark in understanding situations like this, and where and why markets can fail thanks to information asymmetry.</p>

      <title>Another reason why libraries are great</title>
      <description>They reduce this risk in picking books.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Another reason why libraries are great</h1>
<p>Everyone knows the main reasons why libraries are great. You get to read books for free. It is the only place left in our world where you can exist - I mean <em>loiter</em> - without the expectation of spending money. Sharing knowledge to upskill yourself, or your community.</p>
<p>But I have one more reason I want to share: <strong>It makes choosing books much lower risk</strong>. Here me out</p>
<p>If you are buying a book, they cost what $30AUD these days, so if you spent money on this thing, you probably want to enjoy it. In fact, you will probably be annoyed if you spent that money and didn't enjoy it. This will factor into your decision making.</p>
<p>None of this is the case when you are in the library. Do you know anything about algea? No? Pick up a book. If you don't like it, you can return it. You don't even need to finish the book if you don't like it. (Brief aside, Bloom by Ruth Kassinger is a <strong>GREAT</strong> book about algea.)</p>
<p>And once you realise this, it’s kind of thrilling. The whole idea that you don’t need to finish a book just because you started it — that alone is liberating.  Reading becomes less like committing to a project and more like wandering through a field and picking up interesting rocks.</p>
<p>These days I get to go to the library, I go in with barely any plan. I walk around until I spot some topic I don't know anything about and pick it up. Totally risk free!</p>
<p>I like libraries, and I think you should to. If you want to here an actualy librarian talk about librarian stuff, read this <a href="https://drmollytov.dev/2025-03-13">blog by (dr) Molly Tov</a>.</p>
<p>Update: the excellent Dr Molly Tov, &quot;yes and-ed&quot; me in <a href="https://drmollytov.dev/2025-04-22">this blogpost</a>. It is a good read, that you should check out.</p>

<p>It is well known that Physicists have a special relationship with beer. There is just something magical about the amber fluid. Here I want to discuss the ways in which beer and the desire to improve the brewing process furthered humanities analytic chemistry techniques by clever applications of optical physics! We will be discussing the analytic colourimeter, and the refractometer.</p>
<hr>
<h1>1 The Analytic Colourimeter</h1>
<p>The story of the colorimeter comes from the son of a brewer Joseph lovibond.</p>
<p>The brewery faced a difficult problem. How do you get the same level of roast every single time? See brewers by their malts and grains at different levels of roast, from ashy dark, to light blonde, and mix them in the wort to achieve the desired carbohydrate/sugar profile. Getting the recipe consistent is difficult, since you cannot just add the same amount of each ingredient every time, since the roast levels are going to be inconsistent</p>
<p>Lovibond supposedly came to his solution while long through the stained glass windows of his church in 1880 (This story strikes me as something made up for marketing, but I don't have proof it is fake, so let's roll with it). Lovibond realized that you can achieve a continuous gradient of colours by varying the amount of dye* in the glass. From the he created the Lovibond scale, a series of stained glass sheets of defined dye content. The brewer may then compare the colour of their beer to the series of glasses until a match was found.</p>

<em>Credit: <a href="https://www.lovibond.com/lovibond/history">The Lovibond Company Website</a></em></p>
<p>The lovibond company still exists, and still sells colourimetry equipment for use is science and  manufacturing. The company still exists, and still sells instruments for colour measurement, and water analysis. They even still sell an <a href="https://www.lovibond.com/PC/Colour-Measurement/Products/Visual-Measurement/Comparator-System-2000-Visual-Grading">updated version of Lovibond's Device</a></p>

<h1>2 The Refractometer</h1>
<p>If you know anything about Bavaria, you know that they take beer seriously. So seriously they have laws about its contents, and have had protests and riots about its price. You may also know about the rich history of broader German physics. Well I'm 1841 these two areas of excellence crashed together.</p>
<p>While the Bavarian purity laws were in effect, there was little way for the consumer to be confident they received the product they were paying for. Carl August Steinheil, a physicist in Munich established a test in 1841, after inventing the refractometer and combining it with the already existing hydrometer.</p>
<p>Just like light bends through a prism, it also does through a liquid. Go and check with a glass of water now. The refractometer just measures how much the light is bent. This measures the &quot;refractive index&quot; of the liquid. This is useful, since how much a liquid bends the light depends on how much <em>STUFF</em> is in the liquid. Sugars, dextrose etc, and how that &quot;<em>stuff</em>&quot; interacts with light. If you want a more in depth analysis of refraction, I would recommend checking out <a href="https://rainbowspec.observer/prisms/">this explanation</a> by friend of the site <a href="https://solaria.neocities.org/">Solaria</a>.</p>
<p>A hydrometer, a similar tool which already existed, measures the density of a liquid. I.E. the mass of all the stuff dissolved in the liquid. It does this by placing a tuned glass weight to a column of the liquid and measuring how buoyant the rod is in that particular fluid. The more dense the liquid, the higher it will float.</p>
<p>After measuring both the <em>density</em> of the beer <strong>and</strong> its <em>refractive index</em> it is possible to determine both the <em>alcohol content</em> and the <em>extract</em> of the beer.</p>
<p>It turns out Steinheils method was not popular in its time, and he cause some controversies trying to advertise its use over other methods.</p>
<p><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/SteinheilRefractometer_DeustcheMuseum.jpg" alt="A photograph of a brass optical instrument facing a ceramic beer stein"><br>
<em>A photo I took of Steinheil's refractometer while visiting the Deutsche Museum</em></p>
<p>Today, refractometers are used in analysis in a variety of areas. Coffee nerds like using them to measure extraction efficiency, and confectionry manafactureers use them to measure sugar concentration.</p>
<p><strong>Authors Note:</strong> I was curious about Steinheils Optical beer test, there isn't a lot of information on the English speaking web about it. I sent an email to the museum curator asking for some more details. I will update this page if I get any interesting materials from them.</p>

      <title>On the role of technical skills in fighting power</title>
      <description>If you are unhappy with the the powers that be, (regardless of who you think that is), you should understand the tools to fight them. Tip: Regulation wont be enough</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>1 On the role of technical skills in fighting power</h1>
<p>I've been reading Yanis Varifakis's <a href="https://www.penguin.com.au/books/technofeudalism-9781529926095">Technofeudalism: What killed capitalism</a> and have been thinking about the pessimism a lot of progressives have in opposing oligarchy.<br>
Specifically, progressives are often reluctant to engage with techno-capital on its own terms, and instead fall into old habbits of at best, trying to regulate out the problems, or at worst complaining to no end.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I think that <a href="https://craphound.com/">Cory Doctorow</a> provides a strong direction for political action, stronger than most leftie-youtubers/tik-tokers if I am being honest. In <a href="https://craphound.com/category/internetcon/">The internet con: How to seize the means of computation</a> he argues that while freedom of computation and communication is not strictly <strong>more</strong> important than climate change, feminism, economic justice, insert-your-preferred-issue-here, it <strong>is</strong> a necessary component to affecting change to reach those goals. iYou will not be able to out-boycott the capital class when you rely on them for survival, you especially wont be able to use the tools of cloud capital to oppose it.  We have known this for decades, remember when Audre Lorde said this?:</p>
<p><em>“For the master’s tool will never dismantle the master’s house. They may allow us temporarily to beat him at his own game, but they will never enable us to bring about genuine change. And this fact is only threatening to those women who still define the master’s house as their only source of support.”  Audre Lorde (1984)</em></p>
<p>I don't, but she seems smart and her quote is relevant here.</p>
<p>Now, for most people, here comes the hard part. Sometimes.... you need to learn new things.... and sometimes those new things... are not another political philosopher paraphrasing Marx. Political theory is great and all, but lets bring some hard skills to the table.</p>
<p>Opposing the control of cloud capital is easy, but we need to turn the network effect <strong>against</strong> them. There are some steps you can take without much effort, courtesy of the nerds.</p>
<p>Here is a start, from most necessary and easy, up:</p>
<h2>1.1 <strong>Supplement Social Media with RSS</strong></h2>
<p>I am not going to pretend that deleting facebook/instagram/youtube/twitter/bluesky is feasible for everyone just yet. <strong>BUT</strong> you must aknowledge, while you are using them you are at the mercy of their owners. RSS is a technology that has been around for decades. (It was co-developed by absolute legend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">Aaron Swartz</a> ), and lets you build your own newsfeed independent of platform. Here is Cory Doctorows <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/16/keep-it-really-simple-stupid/">argument for RSS</a>. The abbreviated version is, you can follow people without algorithmic manipualiton, and outside the control of the capital class. AND more sites support it than you would think. The more you can get your media consumption onto RSS, the more you can wrangle it back under your control.</p>
<h2>1.2 <strong>Use an adblocker. Take your privacy seriously</strong></h2>
<p>Ads arn't just annoying. They are dangerous. <em>They are a mechanism of control</em>. The digital advertisements we see today are not one-way streets beaming information into your brain. Your computer is beaming information back to them. Every time you see an ad, your computer is finger printed, and your behaviour is tracked across the internet. Using a good adblocker, (UBlock Origin on Firefox is the only one I would recommend), makes you harder to track across the web. Louis Rossman explains this better than I can in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7qWAPVJfj0">video</a>. Friend of the site <em>Starbreaker</em> wrote a blogpost exploring the concept of <a href="https://starbreaker.org/grimoire/entries/advertising-will-never-be-great/index.html">&quot;relevant ads&quot;</a></p>
<h2>1.3 <strong>Set up your own website for digital sovereignity</strong></h2>
<p>Here is where I expect to start losing some people. But I promise you, it isn't as hard as you think, and LLMs (like ChatGPT) have eroded almost all the difficulty. Once you have your own website, you have your own sector of the internet under your control. You can link, communicate and community build outside of the control of any moderators.</p>
<p>Why do you need your own website? Well it depends who you are and what you do. But you probably do something worth keeping track of. Are you an artist or musician, this is where people can track your work. Do you do technical work, document your work. Have heaps of opinions on things? Write a blog.</p>
<p>I know starting a website sounds daunting but the great folks at <a href="32bit.cafe">32BitCafe</a> have a simple tutorial on where and how to start (<a href="https://32bit.cafe/cyowebsite/">https://32bit.cafe/cyowebsite/</a>). If you are on the fence, spend a couple hours playing around with it. It costs nothing, and you might enjoy it.</p>
<h2>1.4 <strong>Start to pry yourself away from the cloud</strong></h2>
<p>Don't forget. &quot;The Cloud&quot; is just someone else's computer.  Escaping entirely from the cloud is going to be impossible, but every step you take is less data they have on you. The FUTO organisation's <a href="https://immich.app/">Immich</a> is an alternative to Google Photos and Apple Cloud. They also have a tracker-less <a href="https://keyboard.futo.org/">keyboard</a> for your android phone (Did you know your default keyboard sends telemetry back to the manafacturer?). <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a> is a self-hostable version alternative to Google Drive, or for an easier option, consider backing up yourself using a Network Attached Storage (NAS). <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-global">Synology</a> sells just-works out of the box options.</p>
<h1>2 Conclusion</h1>
<p>Every step of these you take, removes another bind that cloud-capital uses to control you. It won't fix everything, but it makes the next steps easier - nay - possible. Sometimes material change, requires digital work.</p>
<p>I want to clarify, this is not a call to out-technology the problem. The technology is already here, and is being used against you. I am calling on you to understand the state of modern (class) warfare. The good news is, <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/we-can-have-a-different-web/">the good ol days of the internet are not over</a> and you can be part of it.</p>
<h1>3 Appendix: BlueSky Are NOT your Saviours</h1>
<p>This doesn't quite fit in with the rest of my argument, but it needs to be said somewhere. Bluesky has all the same incentives which enshittified Twitter. It is still under the total control of its owners, who can enforce their will onto you.</p>
<p>If you desperately need to shout your opinions in 300 character outbursts, there are still options however. Look into Mastodon.</p>
<p>Mastodon is built to be <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/23/defense-in-depth/">billionaire proof</a>, because you select your server, and your server admins select who you are federated with. Think of it like email, your gmail account can still message your friends hotmail account. Same idea here.</p>
<p>The process of selecting your server can be intimidating for some. That intimidation is what freedom feels like. For me, I am Aussie, so I want to be moderated by Australians, so I joined Aus.social. There are plenty of other servers to meet your needs though.</p>
<p><em>&quot;But what about my audience?&quot;</em> Your audience wasn't on BlueSky 12 months ago. You migrated from twitter once, you can do it again.</p>

      <title>My PhD Explained at 5 Levels</title>
      <description>Finally getting round to explaining what I actually research</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>So, what on Earth do I actually work on?</strong> Lets explain it at 5 different levels.</p>
<h1>1 Primary School</h1>
<p>I use lasers to talk to astronauts</p>
<p><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/IllumaT.png" alt="A digital render of 2 satellites in orbit. A laser beam originates from Earth's surface and is recieved at the first satellite, which relays it to the second"></p>
<p>Credit: <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/somd/space-communications-navigation-program/whats-next-the-future-of-nasas-laser-communications/">NASA</a></p>
<h1>2 High School</h1>
<p>We use lasers to communicate to communicate with satellites and other things in space. It is like morse code, turning the laser on and off to symbolise &quot;1&quot;s and &quot;0&quot;s. Standard wireless data transfer uses radio, this is what your wifi uses. Moving from radio to laser lets us speed up our data transfer because lasers can blink on/off much faster than radio waves, packing more 1s and 0s into each second.</p>
<h1>3 Adult</h1>
<p>Wireless communication using lasers allows us to achieve far higher data transfer rates than radio. The speed difference is equivalent to moving from copper telephone wires to high-speed optic fiber. My research is taking all the technology from optic fiber networks, and removing the optic fiber.</p>
<p>The catch, is that turbulence, heat, and air density changes bend and blur the laser, like how a road looks wavy on a hot day. I am working on a way of dealing with this!</p>
<p><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/HotRoad.png" alt="A car shimmers in the heat pouring off the asphalt on the highway leading in to Death Valley National Park"><br>
Credit: <a href="https://www.hawaiipublicradio.org/2013-07-01/heat-wave-will-bake-southwest-for-most-of-this-week">Dave Gikey, NPR</a></p>
<h1>4 University Student</h1>
<p>When light, like that from a laser beam, passes through the atmosphere it gets distorted, much like seeing sunlight pass through to the bottom of a pool. This makes it more difficult to couple the beam into optic fiber for the receiver, causing signal loss.</p>
<p>In order to deal with this problem, we use a technique called adaptive optics. This involves measuring the phase of laser beams wavefront, and use deformable mirrors to correct it in real time (about 1,000 corrections a second). I am working on a new type of wavefront sensor for this process.</p>
<p><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/Deformable_mirror_correction.png" alt="Schematic illustration of a deformable mirror correcting a perturbed wavefront. When a wavefront is perturbed for whatever reason, applying a phase shift with half the amplitude (because the reflection doubles the effect) can correct the wavefront to its original shape before perturbation. In such situations a deformable mirror can be used, although the correction is never perfect because the deformable mirror has a finite number of elements (actuators)."><br>
Credit: <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_optics">WikiMedia</a></p>
<h1>5 Industry Expert</h1>
<p>I am developing a novel wavefront sensor for use in Adaptive Optics assisted Free Space Optical Communications. The sensor I am developing leverages photonic technologies to reduce the size weight and power of traditional WFSing techniques and aims to reduce cost and complexity while improving scalability for satellite-to-ground FSOC links</p>
<h1>6 Why we care about all this!</h1>
<p>It turns out communicating with space is super important for day to day life. You use space technology daily when you use GPS to get around. Its not just that, Earth Observation satellites, (who point their cameras at Earth), are used by meteorologists and climate scientist for weather prediction. We also use them for agricultural monitoring, disaster monitoring, and anything where a birds eye view can help.</p>
<p>Space science is also progressing advanced bio-technology, where tissues can be grown in a weightless environment, advanced manufacturing, and the potential for future mining operations.</p>
<p>Currently much of our space technology is bottlenecked by how fast we can downlink data from the satellite. For example, NASAs Hyperspectral Imaging Suite (HISUI) onboard the ISS <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9463743/">generates 300Gb of data every day, but can only downlink 10Gb of it</a>. The rest is saved on external hard-drives, and physically carried down with the astronauts on their way home. This is clearly not something which will scale, which is why I am working on ways of speeding it up.</p>

      <title>Embedding your latest Mastodon Post into your webpage</title>
      <description>Quick tutorial on how to dynamically embed your latest mastodon post into your static webpage</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>I dont care about how it works, what do I need to do?</strong> Scroll to the bottom, and grab the code and instructions there.</p>
<h1>Embedding Mastodon Posts into your Static Web Page</h1>
<p>There are a few tools for embedding Mastodon toots into a webpage. The most straightforward is to get the embedding code straight from mastodon itself.</p>
<p><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/20250321EmbedToot.png" alt="Screenshot highlighting the menu showing embed post"></p>
<p>The problem with this, is you want to grab the latest post, regardless of when you last updated the site?</p>
<p>Well you could use <a href="https://mastofeed.com/">Mastofeed</a>. But this embeds your ENTIRE Mastodon feed.</p>
<p><em>Sigh</em> I guess I'll figure it out myself.</p>
<h1>The Work around:</h1>
<p>As far as I can tell, the Mastodon protocall doesn't have any key for grabbing the latest post directly by URL. The good news is, with a bit of jank-script, we can figure it out.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Grab the RSS Feed</h2>
<p>I realise it is becoming a theme on this website to espouse how much I love RSS. I can't help it. All we are doing here, is using javascript to grab your fediverse rss feed at <code>yourMastodonInstance/@YourUserName.rss</code>, and finding the latest item on it.</p>
<h2>Step 2: Parse it</h2>
<p>From here, you could just extract the details from the RSS feed and insert it into the html. You could do that, or ou could extract the URL for that specific post, and use that to generate the embedded iFrame. (I think that looks cooler)</p>
<h1>TL;DR Where do I get the code?</h1>
<p>You can find the code in the Github Repo for this website with the source code <a href="https://github.com/CaffeineAndLasers/CaffeineAndLasers.github.io/blob/main/content/scripts.js">here</a>.</p>
<p>Just copy and paste the both the <code>embedLatestPost</code> and <code>fetchLatestMastodonPost</code> functions into your <code>scripts.js</code> file (or create it if you don't have one), and make sure you call it at the end of your code with  <code>&lt;script src=&quot;/scripts.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></p>
<p>Now to use the widget, use this snippet, substituting your fediverse instance and username.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
    // Explicitly call the function to fetch and display the latest RSS post
    document.addEventListener(&quot;DOMContentLoaded&quot;, function() {
        fetchLatestMastodonPost(, &quot;&quot;);
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>If you would like to see what that looks like, go to my home page and hit <code>Ctrl+U</code> to see the source code (on firefox, idk what the key combo for chrome is).</p>

      <title>Automating Your RSS Feed with 11ty</title>
      <description>Here is a quick write-up on how to automate a little more of your personal website.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>1 Background</h1>
<p>A while back, I wrote a quick explainer on how to set up your own RSS feed for your site. It was pretty straightforward, and showed you how to hard-code it.</p>
<p>Then I got lazy, updating the <code>feed.xml</code>  file every time I wrote a blog post was becoming a pain.</p>
<p>To resolve this, I opted to use 11ty to auto-update the RSS feed every time I added a new blog-post. This very post will get auto-updated to the RSS feed. I already used 11ty for automating other parts of my site, so this was just a natural extension.</p>
<h1>2 Setting Up Your Environment</h1>
<h2>2.1 Setting Up Eleventy</h2>
<p>Go follow <a href="https://petrapixel.neocities.org/coding/eleventy-tutorial">PetraPixels Tutorial</a> she explains it better than me. From here I will assume you have it set-up somewhat like hers? Deal? Deal!</p>
<h2>2.2 Your Folder Structure</h2>
<p>I am assuming that all your blogposts are in their own sub-directory. So if your folder structure looks like this</p>
<hr>
<pre><code>&gt;Project/
--&gt; Content/
----&gt; Blogs/
------&gt; Blogpost1.html 
------&gt; Blogpost2.html
----&gt;Everything Else
--&gt; Public
----&gt; All the files that 11ty generates
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h1>3 Creating Your RSS Template</h1>
<p>Okay, you did everything and followed Petra's advice? Okay good. Now let's add the required properties to all our blogposts. For every post let's upate the yaml:</p>
<hr>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">---
title: BLOG_TITLE
date: DATE_IN_THE_FORM_YYYY-MM-DD
description: DESCRIPTION
layout: YOUR_TEMPLATE_HERE
---

&lt;Put the actual blog here&gt;

</code></pre>
<hr>
<p>For example, my last blogpost has this in the front-matter.</p>
<hr>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">---
title: How I do my Research (As a PhD Student)
date: 2025-03-16
description: Yet another PhD student explains their personal knowledge management system.
layout: blogpost.liquid
---
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h1>4 Update your .eleventy.js File</h1>
<p>We are adding two more functions to the <code>.eleventy.js</code> file. The first one <code>addCollection</code> just looks for the folder of blog posts, and grabs all the <code>html</code>  file (or <code>md</code> files). This is used by the template later. The second just formats the dates nicely.</p>
<hr>
<pre><code class="language-js">module.exports = function (eleventyConfig) {
  // ... existing code ...
  
  // Add a collection for blog posts
  eleventyConfig.addCollection(&quot;blogPosts&quot;, function(collectionApi) {
    return collectionApi.getFilteredByGlob(&quot;path/to/your/blog/posts/*.{html,md}&quot;).sort((a, b) =&gt; {
      return b.date - a.date; // Sort in reverse chronological order (newest first)
    });
  });
  
  // Add date filter for RSS
  eleventyConfig.addFilter(&quot;dateToRfc822&quot;, function(date) {
    return new Date(date).toUTCString();
  });
  
  // ... existing code ...
};
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h1>5 Update the Feed File</h1>
<p>Final step! let's fix up your feed. Create or edit your rss feed file. Mine is <code>feed.xml</code></p>
<hr>
<pre><code class="language-html">---
permalink: /feed.xml
eleventyExcludeFromCollections: true
---
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;rss version=&quot;2.0&quot;&gt;
&lt;channel&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Your Feed Title&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;description&gt;DescriptionOfYourBlog&lt;/description&gt;
  &lt;link&gt;https://YOURSITEGOESHERE.neocities.org&lt;/link&gt;
  &lt;lastBuildDate&gt;{{ collections.blogPosts[0].date | date: &quot;%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %z&quot; }}&lt;/lastBuildDate&gt;
  &lt;ttl&gt;1440&lt;/ttl&gt;

  {% for post in collections.blogPosts %}
  &lt;item&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;{{ post.data.title }}&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;{{ post.data.description }}&lt;/description&gt;
    &lt;link&gt;https://YOURSITEGOESHERE.neocities.org{{ post.url }}&lt;/link&gt;
    &lt;pubDate&gt;{{ post.date | date: &quot;%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %z&quot; }}&lt;/pubDate&gt;
  &lt;/item&gt;
  {% endfor %}
&lt;/channel&gt;
&lt;/rss&gt;
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p>What is going on here? The important bit is in-between  <code>\{\% for post in collections.blogPosts \%\}</code> and <code>{\% endfor \%\}</code>. This section tells 11ty to go through all the files in the  blogs directory, and generates an RSS entry from all those properties  we went through and added earlier.</p>
<h1>6 Extension: Automating other parts of your page!</h1>
<p>There is no reason to limit ourselves to automating the RSS page.</p>
<h2>6.1 Every Blogpost in bullet points</h2>
<p>Here is a html snippet which will tell 11ty to put every blog post in your folder in dot-points. Use your CSS skills to snazzy it up using the <code>blog-posts-container</code> class.</p>
<hr>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;h2&gt;All My Posts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-posts-container&quot;&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
	{% for post in collections.blogPosts %}
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;a href=&quot;{{ post.url }}&quot;&gt;
				{{ post.date | date: &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot; }}: {{ post.data.title }}
			&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
	{% endfor %}
	&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>6.2 Most Recent Blogpost</h2>
<p>Okay, what if we want to put only the most recent blogpost on our home page. Try out this one</p>
<hr>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;h2&gt;Latest Blog Post&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-posts-container&quot;&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
	{% assign latest_post = collections.blogPosts | first %}
	{% if latest_post %}
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;a href=&quot;{{ latest_post.url }}&quot;&gt;
			{{ latest_post.date | date: &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot; }}: {{ latest_post.data.title }}
			&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
		{% else %}
		&lt;li&gt;No blog posts yet!&lt;/li&gt;
	{% endif %}
	&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

      <title>How I do My Research (As a PhD Student)</title>
      <description>Yet another PhD student explains their personal knowledge management system.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>How I do My Research (As a PhD Student)</h1>
<p>It has almost become a cliche amongst a certain kind of PhD student to explain<br>
<em>Exactly</em> your research workflow, and why it works. Now it is my turn to add to<br>
the pile.</p>
<p>The overall &quot;philosophy&quot; (If you can even call it that) of my Pesonal Knowledge<br>
Management (PKM) system, is minimising friction by allowing emergence. What that<br>
means, is I just use the tools in front of me, and only create systems which<br>
support my habbits, rather than fighting them - If a process is not the easiest<br>
way of doing it in the short term, then eventually I will skip it when I am tired/lazy/bored.<br>
This is not what we want, so instead lets so remove all friction from the process.</p>
<p>There is <strong>one</strong> exception to my zero friction rule. Everything that goes into<br>
my &quot;Second Brain&quot; needs to be written by me. Not copy and pasted, and not by AI.<br>
This isn't for any political or philosophical reason. It’s simply because I<br>
understand things better when I put them in my own words, and my Vault is only<br>
for things I <em>have</em> understood.</p>
<h1>1 Technologies</h1>
<h2>1.1 Obsidian</h2>
<p><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/ObsidianLogo.png" alt="Obsidian Logo"
     style="float: right; width: 25%; margin-left: 10px;"></p>
<p>I don't know how you would have found this post if you do not know Obsidian. Just in case, I will give you a run down on what it is, and why it is perfect for a brain like me.</p>
<p>Obsidian is a text editor, which supports links, back-links and a whole bunch of plug-ins.<br>
It saves every note you take in plain text on your own computer. No cloud BS, no<br>
proprietary file format BS. Just text. This is important, because it means my<br>
notes will outlive Obsidian. If the program is <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/20/capitalist-unrealism/#praxis">enshitified</a><br>
, I can easily port them over to another program (I've been keeping a close eye on<br>
Neovim and Emacs).</p>
<p>The power of Obsidian from a knowledge management perspective,<br>
comes from its ability to manage connections. It supports links just like<br>
Wikipedia, so I am able to &quot;surf my vault&quot;. A feature Extremely handy for when<br>
I half remember something that I am sure that I wrote down somewhere once. It also<br>
works backwards, where from a given note, I can quickly see every note which links<br>
<strong>TO</strong> it.</p>
<h3>1.1.1 Plug-ins</h3>
<h4>1.1.1.1 Dataview</h4>
<p>I don’t use Dataview <em>that</em> much. Mostly, I use it in my daily notes. It lets me search for every note created and last modified on a given date, basically letting me browse my notes over time.</p>
<h4>1.1.1.2 Excalidraw</h4>
<p>I was <strong>extremely</strong> skeptical of introducing Excalidraw to my system. Isn't this a proprietary file format that I will be Shit out of luck if they enshittify? <em>Not quite</em>. The excalidraw plugin lets you export them as .svg. So all my drawings are first exported to SVG and then linked into the relevant note.</p>
<p>This means if they every enshittify, I can go and edit them in InkScape. Not the best solution, but I am definitely not stuck with them.</p>
<h2>1.2 Zotero</h2>
<p><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/ZoteroLogo.png" alt="Zotero Logo"
     style="float: right; width: 30%; margin-left: 10px; pad: 40px" ></p>
<p>Zotero is a freee and open source citations manager. What this means in practice, is it becomes a library of every PDF for every paper I read, with all the bibliographic details logged.</p>
<h2>1.3 Git and GitHub</h2>
<p><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/GithubLogo.png" alt="Zotero Logo"
     style="float: right; width: 30%; margin-left: 10px; pad: 40px" ></p>
<p>My Obsidian  vaults are synchronised between my devices using Github. This solution is a little jankier than the premium obsidian feature, but it is free.</p>
<p>The biggest hurdle to lookout for, is concurrent edits on different devices will almost always create a git merge conflict that will be a nightmare to fix. I have accidentally nuked my vault trying to fix it before (thank god for frequent back ups lol). So, make sure you finish editing, commit and push on one device, before opening on another! (or just pay for the premium feature)</p>
<h2>1.4 Synology Diskstation NAS</h2>
<p>This networked Access Storage Device, is where all my local backups go. It is essentially an external hard drive which plugs into an Ethernet port in my house. Then every networked device in my house, including my computers, phone, tablet and my partners devices, see it as an  attached hard-drive.</p>
<p>I use automatic backups to move everything important onto this regularly.</p>
<h1>2 The workflow!</h1>
<h2>2.1 Literature Review</h2>
<p>The first step, after identifying relevant papers (see the secret step for more details), is to throw the paper into my Zotero database.</p>
<p>Whenever I want to read a paper, Zotero downloads it, grabs the bibliographic information, and saves it all. Once it’s in Zotero, the BetterBibTex plugin will append the details to a .bib file.</p>
<p>Next, I open the PDF in Zotero and switch over to Obsidian. Using the Citations plugin, I tell it to read that .bib file, and it creates a new note for the paper. I have a template set up that automatically puts the relevant details in the heading and pulls the abstract to the top of the note.</p>
<p>Now the actual study begins. How deeply I go depends on how interesting the paper is. At a minimum, I’ll:</p>
<ul>
<li>Link the paper to at least one &quot;parent&quot; note, representing the topic of the paper. For example, a paper about photonic lantern wavefront sensors would be linked to my notes on photonic lanterns and wavefront sensors.</li>
<li>Write a few bullet points summarizing the main point of the paper, or what I thought was important.</li>
<li>Screenshot and copy all the figures into my Vault.</li>
</ul>
<p>From here, if it is an important paper, I will do a close reading, and paraphrase important parts out of the paper into my notes.</p>
<h3>2.1.1 <em>Secret Step</em> <a href="https://caffeineandlasers.neocities.org/blogs/ChiScraperIntroduction">ChiScraper</a></h3>
<p>This tool I  built myself was massively helpful for the early  stages  of my PhD where I was doing a heap of reading and trying to  catch up with the state of research. The website and blogpost explains it in detail, but essentially, this tool filters and ranks articles from the ArXiv, and shows me the papers which are most relevant to me.</p>
<p>If you're a researcher who doesn't use the ArXiv but want to use this tool, ask me nicely and I'll add options for other sources. I have just let the project go into hibernation while it fits  my use case for now.</p>
<p>Check out the project <a href="https://chiscraper.github.io/">here</a> and the blog post <a href="https://caffeineandlasers.neocities.org/blogs/ChiScraperIntroduction">here</a></p>
<h2>2.2 Knowledge Forming</h2>
<p>I consider notes from literature only <strong>half</strong> processed. They’re fully<br>
processed once I’ve abstracted the knowledge and distilled it into the<br>
relevant “parent” notes.  This means I have two types of notes:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Knowledge Notes</th>
<th>Literature Notes</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>- Composed from many sources</td>
<td>- Composed from a single source</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>- Broad basis of knowledge, links to many other ideas liberally.</td>
<td>- Knowledge is specific to the source's study</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For example, I have a note on <strong>Photonic Lantern Wavefront Sensors</strong> which contains everything I know about them, or links to sub-notes with that information (like <em>PL-WFS Reconstruction Techniques</em>). The information in this note should have appropriate citations, with links pointing to the relevant literature notes.</p>
<p>These are the notes I go to when I need to remember something. If I ever find the info I need in a literature note, that’s a sign it should be in a knowledge note, and I copy it over immediately.</p>
<p>When I write these knowledge notes, I use links <strong>extensively</strong>. At a minimum, I'll link to a &quot;parent&quot; note (one level up in abstraction). For example, <em>Photonic Lantern Wavefront Sensors</em> will have links to <em>Photonic Lanterns</em> and <em>Wavefront Sensors</em>. I’ll also link to relevant concepts as they come up: proofs, theorems, principles, etc. And often I’ll have a &quot;See Also&quot; section with links to other relevant notes.</p>
<p>These knowledge notes are where 90% of the content of my notes lives.</p>
<h2>2.3 Structured Notes</h2>
<p>I also have a few templates for specific types of notes.</p>
<h3>2.3.1 Daily and Weekly Notes</h3>
<p>These are mainly scratchpads for temporary information: phone numbers, links, etc. The most important part is the <em>Dataview</em> queries which find every note created on a given day. This lets me quickly skim through my notes over time.</p>
<h3>2.3.2 People</h3>
<p>I have notes for people – coworkers, networking contacts, etc. Not much usually goes in these notes; they mostly exist as a place to link <em>to</em>, and to see backlinks <em>from</em>.</p>
<h3>2.3.3 Meetings</h3>
<p>When I take notes during a meeting, the first thing I do is link to the people notes for all attendees. This lets me quickly check every meeting I’ve had with someone by looking at their person note and checking the backlinks.</p>
<h1>3 Making Sense of the Chaos</h1>
<p>Okay, so that’s how I get knowledge <strong>into</strong> my system. How do I get it <strong>out</strong>?<br>
Links, mostly!</p>
<p>Obsidian’s search is super fast and great. So, when I need a specific note,<br>
a search will find it quickly. If I'm revisiting a topic I’ve already studied,<br>
I can usually find a high-level note for it. From there, I “surf” the links,<br>
re-reading until I find the relevant information. This is also an opportunity<br>
to reshape and form new connections. If it took me a long time to find a specific<br>
bit of information, I go back to what I originally searched for and add a link.<br>
This means my “second brain” is constantly evolving - reformulating links and<br>
connections, just like my first, meat based, brain.</p>
<p>Another example. Let's say I wanted to find info about training a Neural Network<br>
on the outputs of a photonic lantern. This is covered in the paper<br>
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1117/1.JATIS.7.2.028007">Sweeney, D. et,al. 2021. &quot;Learning the lantern: neural network applications to broadband photonic lantern modeling&quot;</a><br>
, but let’s suppose I forgot this.</p>
<p>First, I’d pull up my note for <strong>Photonic Lanterns</strong> and skim it, where<br>
I’d find a note for <strong>Photonic Lantern - Wavefront Sensor</strong>. From there,<br>
I’d see the info on <strong>Photonic Lantern Reconstruction Algorithms</strong> and opening<br>
that note, I’d find the stuff I wrote about NN-based photonic lantern output<br>
approximation, along with a link to the relevant paper.</p>
<p>Here you can see where I can start with a fuzzy, half remembered idea, and quickly resurface a specific paper, rather than scratching my head trying to remember who wrote what from a cold start.</p>
<p>With any hope, this lets me do research and close the loop!</p>
<p><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/PKM_Flowchart.png" alt=""></p>
<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>This is just a broad overview of physically <strong>HOW</strong> I do my research.<br>
Maybe at some point later I will dive deeper into my philosphy of what deserves<br>
a note and how I go about learning. But that is for another  time.</p>
<p>This post was more inspried by the typical &quot;Here is the tools I use&quot; kind of posts<br>
you see on other folks personal web pages. I hope you found it interesting, and<br>
if you feel like chatting ping me an email or connnect on Mastodon!</p>

      <title>Plant Monitor Prototype Update</title>
      <description>Update on the development of a wireless plant monitor prototype, including its features, functionality, and goals.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>My Wireless Plant Monitor! (Prototype)</h1>
<p>I just wanted to do a quick write-up on a side project I'm working on and share photos of an early prototype.</p>
<p><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/20240124Plant.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>What is it:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I am working on an IoT system to monitor my plants and let me know when they need water.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How does it work</strong><br>
<strong>Hardware</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Raspberry Pi Pico W</li>
<li>Core Electronics Capacitive Soil Moisture Meter</li>
<li>Core Electronics Pico Timer</li>
<li>A couple of AA batteries<br>
<strong>Software:</strong></li>
<li>The firmware on the Pico is running MicroPython — a small-footprint port of Python designed to run on embedded devices.</li>
<li>It shoots messages to my main PC via MQTT.</li>
<li>My PC receives the messages via Mosquitto (MQTT broker) running locally.</li>
<li>It then stores the messages in a SQLite database.</li>
<li>A Python Flask app pulls out the data and displays it on a web dashboard.</li>
<li>(The web dashboard is hand-rolled HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why not just...</strong><br>
Why not just buy something, use an existing framework, check my plants myself, do literally anything else with my time.</p>
<p>Because I wanted to build something myself, and see how it works.</p>
<h1>2 Requirements</h1>
<p>I wanted my device to have the following characteristics</p>
<ul>
<li>Communicate wirelessly.</li>
<li>Scalable
<ul>
<li>I have a few plants in a bunch of different places. This means I will need a number of sensors.</li>
<li>This implied several sub-requirements
<ul>
<li>Cost
<ul>
<li>The device should cost less than $30 AUD per unit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Software Scalability
<ul>
<li>The dashboard should scale to support up to 10 clients.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Manufacturability
<ul>
<li>I should be able to assemble future units in less than 30 minutes per unit (not including 3D print time).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Power:
<ul>
<li>The device should last at least a month on a set of batteries.</li>
<li>The device should be powered by disposable alkaline batteries (this is personal preference for convenience, safety, and scalability).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>3 How I built it</h1>
<h2>3.1 Getting the electronics and sensors working</h2>
<p>The first step was to get the physical bits and bobs working and playing nicely together. I threw all the components on a breadboard, plugged the sensor into my microcontroller's ADC, wrote a basic script to print the reading to serial and shut down. Then I tested it on USB power, and then on battery power using the timer. Easy!</p>
<p><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/20240124PlantMonitorBreadboard.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>3.2 Soldering it all in place</h2>
<p>Once I was happy that the electronics worked, I found a leftover soldered breadboard from some previous work and soldered everything down. I also found an old three-pin connector, which was lucky — this meant I could swap out the sensor in case I broke it or something.</p>
<p><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/20240124PlantMonitorCircuitboard.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/20240124Circuitboardback.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>3.3 Write the firmware</h2>
<p>Next up, I had to do a second pass at the firmware and get it actually doing what it was meant to. I got the device to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect to Wi‑Fi.</li>
<li>Take five readings (and average them).</li>
<li>Scale the reading to a calibrated value.</li>
<li>Send it over Wi‑Fi to the base.</li>
<li>Shut down.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Here is where I ran into problems:</strong> For some reason, there was a bug that showed up only when the USB was not plugged in. This was a nightmare to debug. Eventually I hooked up an extra OLED display over I2C just to print out debug statements.</p>
<p>Eventually I figured out the problem and was able to move on. For those curious: I had the device set to restart every 6 seconds. For reasons still unknown, the device could connect to the Wi‑Fi and take its reading in this time on USB power, but it took longer than 6 seconds on battery power, so the restart signal would hit halfway through connecting to the Wi‑Fi and everything would fail. Solution: restart on a one-minute cycle instead of 6 seconds.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>3D print a case</li>
</ol>
<p>It isn't pretty, and I'm not sure it is waterproof, but here is the case for prototype 1.</p>
<p><img src="Assets/20240124FinalProduct.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>3.4 Write the server code</h2>
<p>Now comes the bit that I'm sure most people think is the easy part, but I find tedious. I needed to write the Python code to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Catch the incoming MQTT messages.</li>
<li>Chuck them into a database.</li>
<li>Start a web server.</li>
<li>Grab all the data from the database.</li>
<li>Make it look pretty.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is what I ended up with!</p>
<p><img src="https://caffeineandlasers.com/Assets/20240124PlantMonitorDashboard.png" alt=""></p>
<h1>4 Improvements for V2</h1>
<p>I am sharing the current state of the project, but I wouldn't recommend copying it <em>just</em> yet (at least without a lot of modification). Here is how I plan on improving V2</p>
<h2>4.1 Device housing and footprint design</h2>
<ul>
<li>The housing of the device is god-awful. It is way clunkier than the parts it is made of.</li>
<li>It isn't watertight (I just avoid hitting it when I water the plants).</li>
<li>The batteries aren't even enclosed.
<ul>
<li>The design of the case is a little funny: the switch and the battery replacement hatch are on opposite sides of the box, so I couldn't quite figure out how to enclose it and keep both accessible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>4.2 Electronics</h2>
<ul>
<li>I plan on trying to see if I can reduce the power requirement to a pair of AA batteries, instead of three.</li>
<li>This will help reduce the footprint of the system</li>
</ul>
<h2>4.3 Server Code</h2>
<ul>
<li>At the moment the web page looks very ugly: the graph is reactive which is nice, but the scale on the x-axis isn't working properly and is evenly spacing each measurement regardless of measurement time.</li>
<li>This should be easy to fix, but it requires me to learn a bit more JavaScript.</li>
<li>I would like to deploy the whole thing inside a Docker container.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4.4 Documentation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Now that I have spotted the mistakes in V1 and know what improvements I want in V2,</li>
<li>Version 2 will be properly documented, including:
<ul>
<li>Bill of Materials (BOM)</li>
<li>Documented firmware and server software, including install instructions for the server</li>
<li>3D manufacturing files for the case (e.g., .stl, .3mf, as well as design files)</li>
<li>Photographed assembly instructions.</li>
</ul>
</li>

      <title>Keep Your Ego In Check (Above The Robots)</title>
      <description>The secret to effectively using LLMs is having a bigger ego than the AI. This blog post explores how to harness the power of AI while maintaining human strengths.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Keep Your Ego In Check (Above The Robots)</h1>
<p>In order to use LLMs effectively, you need a bigger ego than the AI. That's the secret.</p>
<p>There's a lot of talk about the rise of &quot;GPT slop&quot; on the internet. People use it as evidence that AI shouldn't be a writing tool. I disagree. I think LLMs are great, <em>if</em> you're confident you can write better than the AI.</p>
<p>But why use an AI if you're better than it? The key is understanding human strengths and weaknesses—that's where the AI comes in. Corey Doctorow calls this the <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/04/17/revenge-of-the-chickenized-reverse-centaurs">Centaur/Reverse-Centaur</a> dynamic.</p>
<p>Humans aren't good at editing, typically. The more we reread something, the less we notice. Reviewing your own work is hard. That's why authors hire editors. It's not just that the editor is inherently better (although that might be true). It's that they have fresh eyes. They haven't reread the same page a hundred times. Fresh eyes catch what the author misses.</p>
<p>Here's how I use AI without creating GPT slop:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Never</strong> let it write the first draft.</p>
<p>Why? You want your own voice. Voice can be preserved through editing, but it is near impossible to inject voice into soulless writing. We're also trying to avoid the Reverse-Centaur problem. Humans do the creative part, robots do the boring part.</p>
<p>I write the first draft myself, keeping it casual. I emphasize my voice, my phrases, metaphors, and flourishes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make the robot do the boring bit.</strong></p>
<p>Then I give it to the AI to catch grammar mistakes and clarify the tone. My first drafts are very casual, full of grammatical errors, more like stream-of-consciousness than an essay. The AI's job is to structure my messy ideas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Realize the AI is as soulless as the corpos that birthed it.</strong></p>
<p>The AI's edit will probably suck. That's the point. When I read what Claude or ChatJippity produces, I think, &quot;That sounds like shit; I liked what I wrote better.&quot; This is key. It clarifies what I like in my writing and helps structure my next step.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Synthesis!</strong></p>
<p>I combine the two versions, keeping what I like from the AI and what I like from my original draft. AI excels at formal/bland/corpo writing; but bad at writing anything more human than a HR memo. So, by doing the casual bit and fusing it with the AI’s strengths I can edit way faster.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That is my general writing process these days. In my experience, this dynamic extendeds more broadly,  the AI is most useful when doing something that you <em>could</em> do yourself, and probably do better - but don't feel like it. You are most likely to fall for its hallucinations when you are asking it to do something you don't know how to do. For example, I fell into the trap the other day when I asked GPT-o1 to derive some maths for me. The results it spat out where 90% correct, but because I didn't know the maths it took me near a full day to fact check it. That's a lesson for another blog-post though.</p>

      <title>Introducing ChiScraper</title>
      <description>Introducing ChiScraper, an open-source tool designed to help researchers streamline their ArXiv experience by combining keyword matching with LLM-powered ranking.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>1 <a href="https://chiscraper.github.io">ChiScraper</a>: Personalised ArXiv Assistant</h1>
<p>Keeping up with the latest research papers can feel like drinking from a firehouse - Especially if you are following the current LLM trend. ChiScraper is an open-source tool that helps researchers take control of their ArXiv experience by combining a powerful keyword matching algorithm with LLM-powered ranking. Instead of wading through endless papers, Chi-scraper shows you what's relevant to your research interests and ranks them by importance.</p>
<p>It's like having a personal research assistant that pre-screens papers before your morning coffee.</p>
<p>Visit the project <a href="https://chiscraper.github.io">website</a>, or the <a href="https://github.com/ChiScraper/ChiScraper">GitHub Repo</a></p>
<h2>1.1 Smart Filtering Made Simple</h2>
<p>The workflow is straightforward: ChiScraper searches ArXiv based on your configured keywords, saves matching papers locally, and then uses AI to rank them by relevance to your interests. You can view the results either in your favorite markdown editor (<em>cough</em> Obsidian) or through ChiScraper's clean web interface.</p>
<p>The ranking algorithm is the part that I am particularly proud of. Instead of running a black box algorithm to maximise &quot;engagement&quot;,  <em>Cough</em> YouTube, the ranking algorithm uses a small LLM with your natural language to rank papers according to your preferences. Just tell the AI what you want to read about, and the AI will skim the abstracts rand rank them for you.</p>
<p>The great thing about simple LLM applications like this, is that it works even with small LLM models you can run locally. The program is written so that users can assign their own OpenAI compatible endpoint. This means you can enter in your OpenAI API key and use a GPT model, or you can run it locally through Ollama for free.</p>
<h2>1.2 Getting Started</h2>
<p>If you're interested in trying ChiScraper, head over to <a href="https://chiscraper.github.io/">the project website</a> for installation instructions and detailed documentation. The setup process is<br>
straightforward, and you can be up and running in minutes, whether you choose to use OpenAI's models or go the local LLM route.</p>
<h1>2 How do I use it</h1>
<h2>2.1 Choosing Your LLM</h2>
<p>We purposely built the program to be model agnostic. For a &quot;just works&quot; config we defaulted to using OpenAI's GPT4o-mini model for the ranking. In my opinion this model is overkill for the task at hand, (but from a design perspective, we want a model which erred on too smart, rather than too dumb).</p>
<p>In my experience, even for highly technical physics papers, models around the 8b mark work well. It works well with <code>llama3.1:8b</code>, but really like using it with <code>qwen2.5:7b</code>, which seems to be even smarter than 8b llama model, and has a slight performance edge thanks to its smaller size.</p>
<h2>2.2 Setting up a routine</h2>
<p><em>&quot;Damn running it locally sounds cool, too bad I don't have a GPU so I cant&quot;</em> - Neither do I!</p>
<p>For non-real-time applications, you can totally run one of these small models on CPU.  That's what I do! On my mid-range cpu, it takes Qwen2.5:7b about 20-40 seconds per paper to summarise.</p>
<p>So I have set it up as a cron job to run the search and rank algorithms in the morning before I make my coffee. Then it is ready before I sit down for the morning.</p>
<h2>2.3 My Configs</h2>
<p>In my opinion, the key to getting the most out of ChiScraper is to start with broader keyword filters and let the AI ranking do the heavy lifting of determining relevance. This ensures you won't miss important papers while still maintaining a focused reading list.</p>
<p>I have a few keyword search configs, that I run daily. There is a basic tagging and filtering mechanism built in which lets us filter based on which keywords marked the paper.</p>
<h3>2.3.1 Free Space Optical Comms</h3>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    &quot;config_tag&quot;: &quot;FSOC&quot;,
    &quot;list_authors&quot; : [],

    &quot;list_keywords_exclude&quot; : [],
    &quot;list_keywords_include&quot; : [
            [&quot;adaptive&quot;,&quot;optics&quot;],
            [ [&quot;atmosphere&quot;,&quot;atmospheric&quot;],&quot;turbulence&quot;],
            [&quot;wavefront&quot;,&quot;sensor&quot;],
            [&quot;free&quot;,&quot;space&quot;],
            [&quot;optical&quot;,&quot;communication&quot;]
    ],
}
</code></pre>
<h3>2.3.2 Quantum Optics</h3>

    &quot;list_keywords_exclude&quot; : [],
    &quot;list_keywords_include&quot; : [
            [&quot;qubit&quot;],
            [&quot;QKD&quot;],
            [&quot;quantum&quot;,&quot;key&quot;,&quot;distribution&quot;],
            [&quot;quantum&quot;,&quot;communication&quot;]

      <title>ChiCurate</title>
      <description>Introducing ChiCurate, an open-source tool designed to help researchers streamline their ArXiv experience by combining keyword matching with LLM-powered ranking.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Introducing ChiCurate: Your Personalized ArXiv Feed</h1>
<p>In the fast-paced world of scientific research, staying up-to-date with<br>
the latest publications is crucial. However, with hundreds of papers<br>
published daily on ArXiv, finding the most relevant ones for your<br>
research can be like searching for a needle in a haystack. Enter<br>
ChiCurate, a simple tool designed to make researchers more efficient,<br>
and unearth the papers they are interested in.</p>
<p>Get it <a href="https://github.com/CJones-Optics/ChiCurate">here!</a></p>
<h2>What is ChiCurate?</h2>
<p>ChiCurate is an open-source tool that creates a personalized ArXiv feed<br>
tailored to your specific research interests. By leveraging the power of<br>
local Large Language Models (LLMs) and the simplicity of RSS feeds,<br>
ChiCurate ranks papers based on their relevance to your work, saving you<br>
valuable time and ensuring you never miss an important publication in<br>
your field.</p>
<h2>Key Advantages</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Personalization</strong>: Unlike traditional RSS feeds, ChiCurate allows<br>
you to describe your research interests in plain language. The AI<br>
then uses this information to rank papers, ensuring you see the most<br>
relevant content first.</li>
<li><strong>Local Processing</strong>: ChiCurate runs on your local machine, ensuring<br>
privacy and giving you full control over the curation process.</li>
<li><strong>Open Source</strong>: The tool is open-source, allowing for community<br>
contributions and customizations to fit various research needs.</li>
<li><strong>Efficient</strong>: While it may take about 15 minutes to process a<br>
day's worth of papers, you can set it up to run automatically each<br>
morning, having your personalized feed ready before you start your<br>
day.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible</strong>: You can easily adjust your research interests or try<br>
different LLM models to optimize the curation process.</li>
<li><strong>Resource-Friendly</strong>: ChiCurate can run on modest hardware, making<br>
it accessible to researchers without high-end computing resources.</li>
</ol>
<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>ChiCurate combines two key technologies:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Local LLMs</strong>: Using Ollama, an open-source tool for running LLMs<br>
locally, ChiCurate analyzes paper titles (and potentially abstracts)<br>
to determine their relevance to your interests.</li>
<li><strong>RSS Feeds</strong>: The tool fetches the latest papers from ArXiv's RSS<br>
feeds, providing a structured and machine-readable interface for the<br>
LLM to process.</li>
</ol>
<p>By describing your research interests to the AI, you create a<br>
personalized algorithm that ranks papers based on their relevance to<br>
your work. This approach gives you the benefits of a curated feed while<br>
maintaining full control over the curation process.</p>
<h2>Installation Guide</h2>
<p>To get started with ChiCurate, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Install Ollama</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>For Linux: <code>curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh</code></li>
<li>For Windows: Install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) first,<br>
then follow the Linux instructions</li>
<li>For MacOS: Download the dedicated installer from the Ollama<br>
website</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pull the LLM Model</strong>:</p>
<p>ollama pull mistral-nemo</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Install ChiCurate</strong>:</p>

python3 -m venv .venv<br>
source .venv/activate<br>
pip install -r requirements.txt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Configure ChiCurate</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit <code>./userData/feeds.csv</code> to include the ArXiv RSS feeds<br>
you're interested in</li>
<li>Modify <code>./userData/userPrompt.txt</code> to describe your research<br>
interests</li>
<li>Adjust <code>config.yaml</code> if needed (e.g., to change the LLM model or<br>
batch size)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Run ArXiv Curator</strong>:</p>
<p>Execute <code>run.sh</code> to start the curation process</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For optimal use, consider setting up a cron job to run ChiCurate<br>
automatically each morning.</p>

      <title>Where are all the aliens?</title>
      <description>They arn't talking to us right now.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>...They just aren't talking to us</h2>
<p>I read a paper exploring a novel explanation for why the universe is so<br>
darn quiet.</p>
<p>For those unacquainted, the <a href="https://www.space.com/25325-fermi-paradox.html">Fermi<br>
Paradox</a> is the simple<br>
question. &quot;Why is the universe so quiet???&quot;. This follows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation">Drake<br>
Equation</a> which is a kind<br>
of napkin math estimate of how many aliens there are in the universe.<br>
You simply take the number of stars in the universe, multiplied by the<br>
percentage of those stars with planets, multiplied by the percentage of<br>
planets in the habitable zone, multiplied by the probability of life<br>
spontaneously developing. While we don't know the true value of any of<br>
these numbers, even a conservative estimate for each says there should<br>
be plenty of aliens out there for us to find. Simply because the<br>
universe is so big, and there are so many stars!</p>
<p>There are many explanations for the Fermi Paradox. Most of them make<br>
great premises for Sci-Fi works. From the great filter hypothesis (seen<br>
in <em>Mass Effect</em>) to the Dark Forest hypothesis (seen in <em>Three Body<br>
Problem</em>), to the Berserker hypothesis (seen in <em>Berserk</em>). A paper that<br>
hit the ArXiv last month has a novel explanation for why we can't hear<br>
any aliens.</p>
<p>In a sentence.</p>
<p><em>They aren't talking to us</em>.</p>
<p>But, why aren't they talking to us? And why can't we overhear them<br>
talking to each other? That is what this paper addresses.</p>
<p>The author of the paper suggests that interstellar civilisations may<br>
prefer to communicate using quantum communication. The reasons for this<br>
are beyond the scope of my blog post, but in short, you can get more<br>
data, faster, and more securely and lets you do a bunch of things that<br>
are impossible in non-quantum communication.</p>
<p>The physics of Quantum Communication puts some hard limits on what we<br>
Earthlings could expect to hear</p>
<p>When we do &quot;classical&quot; communication here on Earth. All that matters is<br>
that the signal is louder than the background noise. Think about<br>
communication like speech, if you cannot hear your interlocutor inside a<br>
noisy restaurant, you will simply ask them to increase their volume, and<br>
you will be able to understand them.</p>
<p>Radio communication on Earth is like a lightbulb in a dark room. It<br>
sends signals in all directions, and if someone can't hear the message<br>
clearly, we just use a stronger &quot;bulb&quot;. This works because we only need<br>
the signal to be louder than the background noise to understand it.</p>
<p>Quantum communication is different. Quantum communication leverages the<br>
particle-like properties of light (or other quantum things). This means<br>
that the limit is no longer that a signal is louder than the background,<br>
but that a large enough percentage of the individual particles that are<br>
sent get received. The consequence of this is that you cannot just &quot;turn<br>
up the volume&quot; if the receiver isn't getting the signal.</p>
<p>This is less like speaking in a restaurant, and more like a game of<br>
catch. If your ball partner is only catching 50% of the balls you throw,<br>
simply throwing more (turning up the volume) won't help improve their<br>
catch rate. Instead, you need to move closer and throw more accurately.</p>
<p>For effective quantum communication, the MAJORITY of the signal<br>
transmitted must be received to work. As a result, quantum communication<br>
requires small wavelengths. These signals would be transmitted by a<br>
telescope on one end, and received by another telescope on the other.<br>
These laser beams of signal can then be passed through space with high<br>
accuracy, allowing most of the signal to land on target.</p>
<p><img src="ClassicalComsvsQComms.svg" alt="Classical Coms Vs Quantm Comms"></p>
<p>This means that if all the aliens out there are communicating using<br>
Quantum communications:</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>.  They must have <strong>extremely</strong> narrow beams. So it is near impossible<br>
for any stray signal to hit us. Remember, the majority of the signal<br>
needs to hit the receiver, and any that hits us isn't hitting the<br>
receiver.</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>.  They must have <strong>MASSIVE</strong> telescopes to suck up all those photons.<br>
And by massive, I don't mean hundreds of meters wide, or even a<br>
kilometre wide. In order to send a quantum signal between us and our<br>
closest neighbour, quantum information theory predicts you would<br>
need a telescope 100 km wide!</p>
<p>The craziest thing about this explanation is that even if aliens wanted<br>
to talk to us, AND had the technology to do so, they would also have the<br>
technology to see that we wouldn't be able to hear them because we do<br>
not have any large enough telescopes.</p>
<p>So quite simply, it is so quiet, because the aliens are not talking to<br>
us.</p>

      <title>The Case For Power CoOps</title>
      <description>Exploring the potential of supplier cooperatives in the power generation industry, particularly with the rise of solar panels and battery storage.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>The Case For Power Generation Supplier-Cooperatives</h1>
<p><strong>Authors Note:</strong> <em>I do not work in the power industry. I am not an expert in power generation. I'm just some dude with ideas. Keep this in mind</em></p>
<p>The invention of Photovoltaic devices (i.e., Solar Panels) and high-capacity battery storage presents new opportunities not possible with traditional power generation methods.</p>
<p>Of particular interest, it allows small to medium-sized entities to enter the power generation market and compete with the big players. I think medium-sized supplier co-ops may be powerful players in the future of electricity generation.</p>
<p><strong>What does this even look like?</strong><br>
For centuries, farmers have pooled commodities into co-ops to trade as blocks. This gives them leverage to negotiate with massive buyers like supermarkets since they are not trying to undercut each other, and large actors do not have an information asymmetry advantage.</p>
<p>We now have many solar panels (generators) and Li-Ion batteries (storage) distributed across our power grids and managed by individuals and families. These individuals are negotiating by themselves with power companies and getting ripped off. So the answer is simple: Why not pool their resources and negotiate with power companies as a single block? This is just a supplier co-op, the same as the farmers'.</p>
<h1>1 Structure</h1>
<p>For such an organization to be successful, it needs to have capabilities within the following four branches:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generation (Solar Panels)</li>
<li>Storage (Batteries)</li>
<li>Buying and selling to and from the grid</li>
<li>Selling to members</li>
</ol>
<p>The neat thing is, not all of this has to be set up at the same time. Starting with a small group of individuals with panels, they can negotiate as a block and then bootstrap the co-op into a larger organization with all four branches.</p>
<p>The larger the co-op, the greater its ability to negotiate on behalf of its members in buying and selling to the grid. This is Union Power if you are a socialist, or just like health insurance if you are a capitalist.</p>
<h1>2 Not Just Panels</h1>
<p>Not every site is a good candidate for solar panels; they don't get enough light, etc. A co-op would let these people contribute as well, paying them for battery storage.</p>
<p>There is no reason that a battery HAS to be plugged directly into a solar panel. The grid could pay people to house and maintain a battery on their property and use that for storing the excess power generated by the panels on other people's properties, paying them for their service.</p>
<h1>3 Incentives Matter</h1>
<p>A co-op, which is owned by its members, can prioritize cheap power for its members over profitability. Therefore, they can make strategic decisions to prioritize their members' needs rather than selling back to the grid. E.g., instead of selling power at a high rate to maximize income, the provider may choose to reserve the power in their batteries to power their members at a lower cost.</p>
<h2>3.1 The Difficulties with Economics</h2>
<p>While economics plays in our favor in some cases, there are a couple of cases where the economics play against us.</p>
<h3>3.1.1 How to incentivize batteries</h3>
<p>At the moment, the incentive for an individual to buy a battery is so that they can store electricity for later use at peak times, rather than selling back to the grid at non-peak prices.</p>
<p>The incentives here are a little different; we want people to store electricity FOR the grid, not for individuals. Incentivising the needs of the co-op over the individual is a little tricky, but not insurmaountable, Here's one idea:</p>
<ol>
<li>The co-op owns the batteries, but members host them.</li>
<li>Instead of paying members based on how much electricity they store (which could lead to selfish behaviour), we pay them a flat rate for hosting the battery.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, let's say Alice agrees to host a co-op-owned battery in her garage. Rather than Alice getting paid $0.05 per kWh stored, she might get a flat $50 per month for providing the space and basic maintenance. This way, Alice is incentivized to host the battery, but she's not tempted to hoard electricity for personal use during peak times.</p>
<h3>3.1.2 Employees VS Owners</h3>
<p>I left this till last because I think it is the most difficult to solve. The incentive structures of capitalism don't disappear just because it is a co-op.</p>
<p>Now, here's where things get tricky. Running an organization this large and complex this isn't a hobby - it will need full-time employees. But remember, our co-op is owned by the members (the folks with solar panels and batteries). This sets up a potential conflict:</p>
<ul>
<li>Employees want good salaries and benefits (naturally!).</li>
<li>Owners want to keep costs low so they can get cheaper electricity.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a typical company, the owners (shareholders) usually have more power. But in our co-op, it's flipped on its head. The employees running the grid will know way more about the business than the average member. This knowledge imbalance could lead to some issues.  For example, the employees will be incentivized to push power prices up for the owners as high as they can while staying cheaper than other commercial options.</p>
<p>Imagine this scenario: The co-op managers (employees) might push for selling electricity to members at $0.12 per kWh, arguing that it's still cheaper than the $0.15 per kWh from the big power companies. The members might not realize that with the co-op's efficient operations, the price could actually be $0.10 per kWh. The extra $0.02 is padding the co-op's budget, potentially leading to higher salaries or unnecessary expenses.</p>
<p>This tricky economic issue could be partially mitigated by making a joint supplier/employee co-op so that employees have skin in the game. This will just trade a power imbalance for a political imbalance between employee-owners and supplier-owners. This combined with appropriate board management, auditing and transparency, I think, will yield more fair results than the current privately owned state of business.</p>
<h1>4 Benefits</h1>
<p>Some of the benefits I see are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Power Prices to the consumer</li>
<li>Environmental:  Larger organisations of Solar Panel owners can share the size and power as legacy generators, who still have a vested interest in fossil fuel generation.</li>
<li>Community/Political: This gives back power to the people 💪💡⚡💪💡⚡We are so used to outsourcing our fundamental needs to people in suits far away. A supplier co-op  lets regular people engage with society, power and economics in a hands on way,</li>
</ul>
<h1>5 Conclusions</h1>
<p>I think the idea is neat. If you like the idea or want to use it you can buy me a beer. This concludes the licensing agreement.</p>

      <title>What Science Says About Coffee Grinding</title>
      <description>Delving into the scientific aspects of coffee grinding, exploring the effects of electrostatic charges and strategies to mitigate them for a better cup of coffee.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Four Coffee Observations in Two Studies</h1>
<p>There is something beautiful about scientists being given the freedom to<br>
apply their skills to passion projects. High-impact science is valuable,<br>
but the purity of studying a hobby out of sheer interest is something I<br>
will always appreciate.</p>
<p>Here are four observations from two scientific papers on the practice of<br>
coffee grinding. Experienced coffee nerds might know some of these<br>
intuitively, but now we have graphs to back them up.</p>
<h2>1. Study One: Chemical strategies to mitigate electrostatic charging during coffee grinding</h2>
<p>One interesting aspect of coffee grinding is the role of electrostatic<br>
charges. When you grind coffee, the particles become charged, causing<br>
them to clump together and stick to the sides of the grinder. This can<br>
be annoying, as it creates a mess on your coffee station, but it can<br>
also significantly impact the quality of the coffee.</p>
<p>When coffee grounds clump together, water can't flow through them evenly<br>
during brewing. This uneven extraction leads to what's known as<br>
&quot;channeling,&quot; where water finds the path of least resistance and flows<br>
through only part of the coffee bed. The result is a cup of coffee<br>
that's less flavorful and more bitter than it should be. This paper<br>
quantifies two strategies used to minimize this effect.</p>
<h3>1.1 Electrical De-ionizers</h3>
<p>Many modern &quot;luxury&quot; grinders include high-voltage ionizers fitted on<br>
the exit chute of the grinder. The idea behind this device is to bombard<br>
the coffee grinds with charged particles, which neutralize any static<br>
charge picked up during the grinding process.</p>
<p><img src="CoffeeGrindsPaper1Fig3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The graphs shown in <em>d</em> and <em>b</em> demonstrate that fitting an electrical<br>
de-ionizer does indeed reduce the charge buildup on the coffee grinds.</p>
<p>But this isn't the end of the story. Does this reduction in static<br>
charge translate into a better cup of coffee? Observing the bottom<br>
graphs in Figure 5 shows almost no difference between espresso prepared<br>
with and without the de-ionizer. The researchers note that the flavor<br>
difference is negligible as well.</p>
<p>How do we understand this result? The reason seems to be that by the<br>
time the de-ionizer does its job, the damage has already been done---the<br>
coffee grounds have already clumped together.</p>
<p>So while a de-ionizer might make your coffee station less messy, it's<br>
not going to make your coffee taste better.</p>
<p>This raises an interesting question: Could combining a de-ionizer with a<br>
grind distribution tool improve the situation? While de-ionizing the<br>
coffee grinds does not cause the clumps to dissipate on their own,<br>
perhaps it can make them easier to break apart with a coffee<br>
distribution tool?</p>
<h3>1.2 Spritzing the beans with water.</h3>
<p>Another method for reducing static is much simpler: just spritz your<br>
coffee beans with a little water before grinding. The idea is that the<br>
water will dissipate charge as soon as it builds up. This method is much<br>
lower-tech than the solution described above, but how does it compare?</p>
<p>The researchers measured a reduction in static charge when a small<br>
amount of water was added to the coffee before grinding. It also<br>
resulted in lower retention (i.e., how much coffee gets stuck in the<br>
grinder) and reduces the grind coarseness, and increases grind<br>
uniformity.</p>
<p><img src="CoffeeGrindsPaper1Fig4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So how does this affect taste? The study observed that the addition of<br>
water leads to a slower flow rate during brewing, which results in a<br>
more concentrated extraction---especially with darker roasts. This is<br>
also illustrated in figure 5.</p>
<p><img src="CoffeeGrindsPaper1Fig5.png" alt=""></p>
<h3>1.3 Lessons from this paper</h3>
<ul>
<li>Grinders fitted with an electrical de-ionizer do not produce better<br>
coffee but do result in less mess when making coffee.\</li>
<li>Treating beans with a spray of water reduces clumping, resulting in<br>
increased extraction and lower grinder retention.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Study Two: The effect of bean origin and temperature on grinding roasted coffee</h2>
<p>The second study focused on how different factors related to the coffee<br>
beans themselves affect grinding</p>
<p>This paper compares the effects of both bean origin and bean temperature<br>
prior to grinding.</p>
<h3>2.1 The Effect of Bean Origin</h3>
<p>Will different single-origin coffees grind differently? For once, the<br>
answer is simple: NO!</p>
<p><img src="CoffeeGrindsPaper2Fig3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It appears that between different coffees, the grind distribution<br>
produced by the EK43 commercial are near identical for all of them.</p>
<ol>
<li>Four speciality grade coffees were ground to study grind profile<br>
variations.</li>
<li>Grind profiles showed a skewed-Gaussian shape with particle sizes<br>
ranging from 0.1 μm to 1000 μm.</li>
<li>All coffees had similar grind distributions, with minor differences<br>
in number modes and fine particulates cutoff.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a couple things to note here: - All 4 coffees tested were<br>
light/medium roast - This test was only done on an EK43 grinder</p>
<p>There are a couple of things to note here:\</p>
<ul>
<li>All four coffees tested were light/medium roast.\</li>
<li>This test was only done on an EK43 grinder.</li>
</ul>
<p>This raises a few questions about the generalization of the study:\</p>
<ol>
<li>Do darker roasts have the same particle size distribution as light<br>
roasts?\</li>
<li>If not:\</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Are they self-consistent, like the lighter ones are?\</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>The EK43 is an expensive commercial grinder. How consistent are<br>
cheaper home grinders?</li>
</ol>
<h3>2.2 Effect of Bean Temperature</h3>
<p>If you've ever ordered one of those expensive coffees---like the ones<br>
that cost more than $10 a cup---you may have seen the barista pull the<br>
coffee out of a freezer. The reason for this is obvious: they want to<br>
keep the good stuff fresh for as long as possible. These baristas tend<br>
to develop an intuition that freezing the beans makes them &quot;shatter&quot;<br>
more evenly. So how accurate is their intuition?</p>
<p>It turns out it's quite accurate!</p>
<p><img src="CoffeeGrindsPaper2Fig4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The paper's analysis shows that decreasing the temperature of the beans,<br>
all the way down to -196°C, decreases both the average size of each<br>
particle and reduces the &quot;spread&quot; of coffee grind sizes.</p>
<p>The intuition of shattering beans turns out to be an accurate<br>
description of what is happening here. While there are (almost) no ice<br>
crystals within the bean to shatter, the bean itself has a crystalline<br>
structure sensitive to temperature. So chilling the beans really does<br>
cause them to shatter when you hit them.</p>
<p>However, there are some caveats. As the beans pass through the grinder,<br>
they warm up due to friction and contact with hot grinder blades. This<br>
causes diminishing returns both as the coffee gets colder and as the<br>
grinder is set finer.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this effect seems to be reversible. Coffee that's cooled<br>
to extremely low temperatures and then warmed back up to room<br>
temperature behaves just like coffee that was never cooled in the first<br>
place.</p>
<h1>3. So what did we learn?</h1>
<p>The actionable takeaways from this mini deep dive are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Adding water to your coffee pre-grind improves extraction, reduces<br>
retention, and slightly decreases coarseness.\</li>
<li>Freezing coffee increases grind size uniformity.\</li>
<li>The electrical de-ionizer on expensive grinders helps reduce mess<br>
but does not appear to improve your coffee's quality (although<br>
combining de-ionization with distribution tools has not been<br>
studied).\</li>
<li>Different coffees will have similar grind profiles on the same<br>
grinder with identical settings.</li>
</ol>

      <title>LoFi Terminal</title>
      <description>A minimalist audio player that does its job without any frills.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>1 Announcing My LoFi Terminal Radio</h1>
<p>This was a short weekend project I threw together to replace the<br>
perpetually open YouTube Tab for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfKfPfyJRdk">lofi beats to relax/study<br>
to</a>. The result? A<br>
minimalist audio player that does its job without any frills. Here's<br>
why I created it and how it works.</p>
<h1>2 What is it</h1>
<p>In short, it is an audio player with a very specific emphasis on<br>
being: - minimalist - distraction-free You cannot select tracks, replay<br>
tracks or go to the next track. This is a feature, not a shortcoming. If<br>
you want different music, change the station.</p>
<p>The aim of this is to provide an experience akin to radio. You can turn<br>
it on, change the volume and switch the channel, but the programming is<br>
up to the DJ.</p>
<h1>3 Why Design it like this</h1>
<p>This program isn't to replace your spotify or main music player.<br>
Instead it is to replace your <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfKfPfyJRdk">lofi beats to relax/study<br>
to</a> Youtube tab that stays<br>
open while you work. The channel has 15k streamers on it when I checked,<br>
and has streaming uninterrupted since July 2022.</p>
<p>Why does this exist? Much like some art makes you think, and some exists<br>
just to decorate space. Some music exists to make you think, and some<br>
exist to decorate time. When you get these two types confused your<br>
&quot;background music&quot; can become the focus, distracting you from the work<br>
you are meant to be doing. These &quot;lofi hip-hop&quot; streams exist to play<br>
background music and remove the temptation of fiddling with the<br>
playlist.</p>
<p>The problem is, a 1080p video stream running in a web browser is<br>
super-overkill for listening to music. It wastes network bandwidth,<br>
computer memory, and CPU cycles. On top of this, it removes the<br>
distraction of fiddling with playlists but replaces it with the visual<br>
clutter of an unnecessary browser tab next to your actual work</p>
<h1>4 My Solution</h1>
<p>A tool to replace this should have 1. No way to select tracks or<br>
configure playlists from the UI 2. Stay out of the way when you aren't<br>
using it</p>
<p>For this, I settled on a discrete terminal app that I can stash neatly<br>
out of the way. Especially when I leave it running in my <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/6307/quake-terminal/">Quake<br>
Terminal</a><br>
extension for GNOME.</p>
<p><img src="lofiRadio.png" alt="Screenshot of the UI"></p>
<h1>5 Where Do I install it?</h1>
<p>Install instructions at <a href="https://github.com/CJones-Optics/lofi-player">My<br>
Repo</a></p>
<h1>6 Customising it</h1>
<h2>6.1 Colours!</h2>
<p>The UI is determined by css, with the colours defined at the top of the<br>
file. Change your colour scheme to whatever you want just by changing<br>
the hex codes at the top of the css file.</p>
<h2>6.2 Keybindings!</h2>
<p>Don't like vim? Iwon't hold it against you. There is a simple text<br>
file of the keybindings. Change the key to whatever you need.</p>
<h1>7 Does it work on:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Linux
<ul>
<li><strong>Yes!</strong> I have tested it on two machines and a virtual machine</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mac
<ul>
<li><strong>Probably!</strong> I haven't tested. Try it and let me know. I<br>
can't afford a Macbook.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Windows
<ul>
<li><strong>Eventually!</strong> There are some bugs specific to Window's<br>
implementation of Python. (Or maybe Linux's implementation?)<br>
Either way, it doesn't work as perfectly on Windows. It will be<br>
fixed when I get around to it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>8 This is all well and good, but who has MP3 files anymore?</h1>
<p>You got me there! Spotify support isn't really something I can be<br>
bothered messing with. Instead, I built my playlists from the Royalty<br>
Free resources available at<br>
<a href="https://pixabay.com/music/search/lofi/">Pixbay</a>, but for artists, you<br>
are genuinely fond of you can actually support them by buying their<br>
music through Bandcamp.</p>
<h1>9 Technical Details</h1>
<h2>9.1 Frameworks</h2>
<ul>
<li>Both the backend and UI are written in Python
<ul>
<li>Backend uses PyGame to handle the mp3 playback</li>
<li>Frontend uses the Textual Framework to handle keybindings, and<br>
tcss for a css-like experience configuring the UI</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>9.2 How it works:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The player process grabs a directory of mp3 files, and a playlist<br>
object grabs each file one at a time, and throws it at the player<br>
object when it needs a new song.</li>
<li>A queue is used to pass commands from the UI in <a href="http://TUI.py">TUI.py</a>, to the<br>
process in <a href="http://musicPlayer.py">musicPlayer.py</a> and messages back in the other direction.</li>
</ul>
<h2>9.3 Customisability</h2>
<p>At the moment the application is optimised for my specific use case. And<br>
I am very opinionated. This means: -The entire program is controlled<br>
from the keyboard, with vim keybindings - No &quot;Next&quot; button is exposed<br>
in the UI.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the frameworks used are very flexible, allowing for easy<br>
hackability. To change the colours of the UI, you only need to change<br>
the hexcodes in <code>style.tcss</code>. To add mouse support, you can easily<br>
implement buttons using Textualise's built-in widgets. In fact, the<br>
repo has a spare folder for GUI elements I designed, (then removed) to<br>
get you started.</p>
<p>The process also already has a command written for the next track. You<br>
only need to add the UI element if you really want it.</p>
<h1>10 Future Changes</h1>
<p>Future changes are unlikely because it currently fits my use case.<br>
However for the sake of completeness, here is how I may extend the<br>
application. - Custom theming. - At the moment I have a Catpuccino theme<br>
hardcoded into it. An implementation to vary the colour scheme would be<br>
simple to implement and highly beneficial - Implement GUI and Mouse<br>
Support. - I have a soft spot for text-only UIs, which is why it is<br>
implemented like this. The framework does support buttons for mouse UIs<br>
though. The app does work with buttons but I thought they were ugly and<br>
removed them. Check the commit history for implementation -Old School<br>
animated music visualiser: - This is somewhat antithetical to the design<br>
philosophy, but they are a lot of fun. I plan on building one<br>
eventually.\</p>
<ul>
<li>GUI Support Cont: Implement a list feature for all the stations.</li>
</ul>
<h1>11 Conclusion</h1>
<p>The LoFi Terminal Radio aims to provide a distraction-free,<br>
resource-efficient alternative to streaming background music. If you're<br>
looking for a minimalist approach to your work soundtrack, give it a<br>
try! Feedback and contributions are always welcome.</p>

      <title>RSS</title>
      <description>A short explainer on how to set-up your very own RSS feed</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>1 What Is RSS and why might your readers want it?</h1>
<p>The acronym for RSS is &quot;Really Simple Syndication&quot;. Essentially, it is a way better method of alerting your readers to your new blog posts, without requiring an email address.</p>
<h2>1.1 How it works</h2>
<p>Your users will have an RSS Reader. This program keeps a list of webpages to check every refresh period, and presents all the new articles to the user.</p>
<h2>1.2 Why not use email?</h2>
<ul>
<li>&quot;I wish I had more emails in my inbox &quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I love signing up for things and giving my email to strangers&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I've never had my email address leaked in a data breach&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>RSS beats email because it makes more sense. The user lets <strong>YOU</strong> know when they want to read, not the other way around. You don't need a long list of email addresses, and quite frankly you don't want one.</p>
<h1>2 How to set it up:</h1>
<p>All you need to setup an RSS feed is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a feed page for your website</li>
<li>Provide a link to it</li>
<li>Update the feed every time you add a new blogpost</li>
</ol>
<p>The users RSS reader handles the rest</p>
<h2>2.1 Creating the Feed Page:</h2>
<p>First create your file. The name doesn't matter too much, but should end in <code>.xml</code> since that is the file-type. Mine is simply called <code>feed.xml</code>.</p>
<p>The structure of your feed should look like this, with your own info replacing the bits I have in {brackets}</p>
<hr>
<pre><code class="language-{.sourceCode">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; ?&gt;
&lt;rss version=&quot;2.0&quot;&gt;
&lt;channel&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;{The Name of your Blog}&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;description&gt;{A short description of your blog}&lt;/description&gt;
  &lt;link&gt;{Link to your homepage}&lt;/link&gt;
  &lt;lastBuildDate&gt;
    {Date and time in RFC 2822 format}
  &lt;/lastBuildDate&gt;
  &lt;ttl&gt;{Number of minutes between refreshes}&lt;/ttl&gt;




&lt;/channel&gt;
&lt;/rss&gt;
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p>RFC 2822 Timestamps look like this: <code>Thu, 08 Aug 2024 23:52:25 +0000</code> And can easily be generated from this website: <a href="https://timestampgenerator.com/">https://timestampgenerator.com/</a></p>
<p>The <code>ttl</code> field instructs how often an RSS reader should wait between refreshing the page. E.g. if you set it to 60, each RSS reader will refresh your page once per hour. I rarely update my blog. So I have it set to 1440 so it updates once a day, so that my web page doesn't get hammered with too much traffic.</p>
<h2>2.2 Adding Articles to the feed</h2>
<p>The block above is for an empty feed. We will want to add articles to<br>
it!</p>
<p>The template for each item:</p>
<hr>
<pre><code class="language-{.sourceCode">  &lt;item&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;{Article Title}&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;
      {A short description or preview of the article}
    &lt;/description&gt;
    &lt;link&gt;{Link to the the web page of the article}&lt;/link&gt;
    &lt;pubDate&gt;
      {Time and date in RFC 2822 format}
    &lt;/pubDate&gt;
  &lt;/item&gt;
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p>Each item goes in between the <code>ttl</code> tag and the <code>&lt;\channel&gt;</code> tag. Every<br>
time you add an article, don't forget to update the <code>&lt;lastBuildDate&gt;</code><br>
tag.</p>
<h2>2.3 Putting it all together:</h2>
<p>In the end your RSS feed should look like this:</p>
<hr>
<pre><code class="language-{.sourceCode">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; ?&gt;
&lt;rss version=&quot;2.0&quot;&gt;
&lt;channel&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;{The Name of your Blog}&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;description&gt;{A short description of your blog}&lt;/description&gt;
  &lt;link&gt;{Link to your homepage}&lt;/link&gt;
  &lt;lastBuildDate&gt;
    {Date and time in RFC 2822 format}
  &lt;/lastBuildDate&gt;
  &lt;ttl&gt;{Number of minutes between refreshes}&lt;/ttl&gt;

  &lt;!-- Above this is the header, below are each article --&gt;

 &lt;item&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;{Article One}&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;
      {A short description or preview of the article}
    &lt;/description&gt;
    &lt;link&gt;{Link to the the web page of article 1}&lt;/link&gt;
    &lt;pubDate&gt;
      {Time and date in RFC 2822 format}
    &lt;/pubDate&gt;
  &lt;/item&gt;

 &lt;item&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;{Article 2}&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;
      {A short description or preview of the article}
    &lt;/description&gt;
    &lt;link&gt;{Link to the the web page of article 2}&lt;/link&gt;
    &lt;pubDate&gt;
      {Time and date in RFC 2822 format}
    &lt;/pubDate&gt;
  &lt;/item&gt;


&lt;!-- End of the article list --&gt;

&lt;/channel&gt;
&lt;/rss&gt;
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p>Check out my RSS for a full example. of what the text looks like.</p>
<h2>2.4 Linking the to the RSS Feed</h2>
<p>Now that you have created the feed, you need a way to drive users to subscribe. All the user needs is the URL of the page you created.</p>
<p>It is customary to use the RSS logo you can see at the bottom of my page to link it it. If you go ahead and click on it, you will see it brings you to an empty looking page. Thats because the page isn't for you. It is for the programs. So you can go ahead and copy and paste that logo into your RSS Reader to subscribe to me 😉.</p>
<h1>3 Wrapping Up</h1>
<p>Thats all you need! Don't forget to add a new item to your feed when<br>
you update your blog! No other maintenance needed. Feel free to use the button below for your RSS feed, and subscribe to my feed using the icon in my site's footer.</p>

      <title>Perceptibility</title>
      <description>Exploring the intersection of philosophy, psychology, and physics in understanding perception and the self.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Observing the observer: Perception in Philosophy Psychology and Physics</h1>
<p><strong>What Do Descarte, Buddhists and Astrophysicists have in common?</strong></p>
<h1>The Answer?</h1>
<p>To give a short answer. Fundamental appreciation of one's own<br>
epistemologic limitations and an understanding of the self-referential<br>
nature of perceiving one's existence.</p>
<p>In non-jargon: They pay attention to what they are paying attention to.<br>
In order to better understand this, lets take a brief tour through<br>
philosphy, psychology and astrophysics.</p>
<h1>Descartes Says: &quot;Cogito, Ergo Sum&quot; {#cogito-ergo-sum}</h1>
<p><em>I think therefore I am</em></p>
<p>A famous line everyone has heard before. Let's cover what Descartes<br>
meant by this.</p>
<p>Descartes was a <em>Skeptic</em>. He wanted to answer the question &quot;What can I<br>
know for SURE&quot;. While this seems simple, it reveals some deeper<br>
questions. Can you trust your eyes? What about opical illusions? Can you<br>
trust your ears? What if you are hallucinating? If we cant trust our<br>
senses, what can we trust?</p>
<p>This question drove him insane until he came to one very important<br>
discovery.</p>
<p><em>Cogito, Ergo Sum - I think therefore I am</em></p>
<p>What this means, is that while we can doubt our knowledge, our eyes,<br>
ears and smell, we cannot doubt our own existence. Because any doubt<br>
itself is proof of our own existence.</p>
<p>This is such a profound statement, because stating it itself, is proof<br>
that it is not false. Even if you doubt your senses or your reasoning,<br>
it must still be true.</p>
<p>From this observation, Descartes (and thousands of philosophers after<br>
him) tried (and failed) to axiomatically reconstruct all of human<br>
knowledge. This fundamental axiom remains unchanged. You exist, because<br>
you can observe yourself.</p>
<h1>Anthropic principle</h1>
<p>In 1973, Brandon Carter changed astrophysics forever when he coined the<br>
&quot;Anthropic principle&quot;. This principle states that the fact that <em>we</em><br>
exist, is a necessary condition for us to make observations about the<br>
universe. This means that the range of observations that could be made<br>
about the universe is limited by the fact that observations can only be<br>
made within a universe capable of creating intelligent observers. An<br>
excellent anaology is to consider a sentient puddle of water, who is<br>
amazed at how perfectly the hole it is in fits it. The puddle's<br>
misconception is that the hole was made for it, when in reality, the<br>
puddle was made out of the hole.</p>
<p>This principle starts to explain why it seems like the universe is<br>
finely tuned to produce life. That is because, if it wasn't, we<br>
wouldn't be here to notice it. It puts limits on the physical<br>
constants, the age of the universe and possibly why we haven't found<br>
aliens.</p>
<p>For example, why is the universe as old as it is? If it were a tenth of<br>
its current age, there would not be enough metal in the universe to<br>
sustain intelligent life. If it were ten times its current age there<br>
would not be enough active stars alive in the universe to maintain human<br>
life. Therefore, it is no coincidence that we live in a universal golden<br>
age. If we weren't then we wouldn't exist to notice that it is a<br>
golden age.</p>
<p>The anthropic principle is invoked many times in astrophysics to explain<br>
the remarkable coincidences we see in nature.</p>
<h1>Mindfulness</h1>
<p>Mental health practitioners, Buddhists, and plenty of wise people<br>
recommend mindfulness for managing anxiety and depression. This practice<br>
emphasizes observing one's thoughts and feelings from a detached<br>
perspective. It implicitly recognizes the existence of a conscious<br>
observer separate from the contents of consciousness.</p>
<p>In practice, a mindfulness exercise involves letting yourself feel<br>
emotions and experience thoughts while observing those emotions and<br>
thoughts from a detached perspective.</p>
<p>This is sometimes called meta-attention. Paying attention to your<br>
attention. The aim of practising meta-attention is to decouple your<br>
consciousness from your observations and thereby break the thought loops<br>
that cause anxiety and depression.</p>
<p>Mindfulness extends from the Buddhist and Hindu traditions and is backed<br>
by modern cognitive psychology. The practice of observing one's<br>
thoughts as the physical process of natural laws is a powerful tool for<br>
understandng ones place in the universe.</p>
<h1>So what ties these things together?</h1>
<p>The common thread linking these three concepts is the acknowledgment of<br>
consciousness or subjective experience as a fundamental starting point<br>
for understanding reality.</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Epistemological starting point</strong>: All three ideas recognize that<br>
our subjective experience is the starting point for knowledge. We<br>
can't step outside our consciousness to view reality<br>
&quot;objectively.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Self-referential nature</strong>: Each concept involves a kind of<br>
self-reference. Mindfulness observes the observer, Descartes uses<br>
thought to prove the thinker, and the Anthropic Principle considers<br>
observers observing the conditions for their own existence.</li>
<li><strong>Limits of knowledge</strong>: All three ideas implicitly acknowledge the<br>
limitations of what we can know. Mindfulness reveals the constructed<br>
nature of our experiences through our senses and Descartes'<br>
scepticism provides a starting block to build our knowledge off of.<br>
Finally, the Anthropic Principle reminds us that our observations<br>
are inherently biased by our own existence.</li>
<li><strong>Importance of perspective</strong>: Each concept emphasizes the role of<br>
the observer's perspective. Mindfulness shifts perspective,<br>
Descartes isolates a singular perspective, and the Anthropic<br>
Principle accounts for the observer's perspective in cosmological<br>
theories.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Where else does the role of the observer come up in study?</h1>
<h2>Plato's Cave</h2>
<p>Plato's Cave is a philosophical parable that addresses the nature of<br>
reality and human perception. It is another concept very relevant to<br>
these concepts of observability. The allegory is summarised :</p>
<ol>
<li>Prisoners are chained in a cave, facing a wall. They have lived<br>
facing this wall their entire life..</li>
<li>Behind them, a fire casts shadows on the wall from objects passing<br>
in front of it.</li>
<li>The prisoners can only see these shadows and believe them to be<br>
reality.</li>
<li>If a prisoner is freed and sees the true world outside the cave,<br>
they would at first be confused and disbelieving.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/An_Illustration_of_The_Allegory_of_the_Cave%2C_from_Plato%E2%80%99s_Republic.jpg" alt="Platos
Cave" title="Plato's Cave"></p>
<p>Copyright: Wikimedia Commons. 2018. Sharealike license</p>
<p>The lesson we learn from Plato's Cave is to consider how our perception<br>
limits our understanding of the universe. Plato argues that the<br>
philosopher is like the prisoner who escapes the cave to understand the<br>
world, while the unenlightened are content not knowing even what they do<br>
not know.</p>
<p>Plato's cave also prompts us to consider our own subjective existence<br>
in relation to our observations of the universe. Much like the prisoners<br>
mistake shadows for reality, mindfulness encourages us to not mistake<br>
our own thoughts and feelings for reality.</p>
<h2>Heisenberg Uncertainty Principal</h2>
<p>While less philosophically dense, Quantum mechanics is another topic<br>
which centres observability within its epistemic framework. Quantum<br>
mechanics centres the role of the observer within it via the Heisenberg<br>
Uncertainty principle.</p>
<p>This principle places a limit on what we can know because the action of<br>
making an observation itself will affect the state of the thing we are<br>
observing. Mathematically this is expressed as:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdisplaystyle%20%5CDelta%20x%20%5CDelta%20p%20%5Cgeq%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Chbar%7D%7B2%7D" alt="Delta x Delta p geq
frac{hbar}{2}" title="\Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}"></p>
<p>This means, that the more precisely we know a particle's position<br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20x" alt="x" title="x"><br>
, the less precisely we know its<br>
momentum<br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20p" alt="p" title="p"><br>
and vice versa. This is because<br>
to figure out a particle's location, you need to interact with it in<br>
some way. This interaction affects its momentum.</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics even encodes the act of observing as a mathematical<br>
operation, expressed as a bra<br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20%5Clangle%7BO%7D%7C" alt="langle{O}" title="\langle{O}|"><br>
and &quot;reality&quot; as a ket<br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20%7C%7BR%7D%5Crangle" alt="{R}rangle" title="|{R}\rangle"><br>
. The observation of reality is<br>
calculated as a probability by multiplying the two:<br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20%5Clangle%7BO%7D%7C%7BR%7D%5Crangle%20%3D%20p%28O%29" alt="langle{O}{R}rangle =
p(O)" title="\langle{O}|{R}\rangle = p(O)"></p>
<h1>Concluding thoughts</h1>
<p>To be completely honest, I don't know how to tie this blog post<br>
together, other than noticing the interesting pattern of the role of the<br>
observer in so many different fields.The act of decoupling the concept<br>
of observing from understanding true reality, we have made strides in a<br>
wide range of fields, from philosophy, and psychology to astrophysics,<br>
and quantum physics.</p>
<p>If you can tie this idea of perceptibility to your own work let me know,<br>
either email me or hit me up on mastodon, because I am very interested<br>
to see where else it has come up. I hope to write a future blog post<br>
tying the concept of perceptibility to determinism and free will. So<br>
stay tuned for that!</p>

      <title>An Introduction To LCOS</title>
      <description>An introduction to Liquid Crystal on Silicon (LCOS) technology, covering its principles, applications, and the author's personal experience working with it.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From my time at Finisar I got to work extensively with <strong>L</strong>iquid<br>
<strong>C</strong>rystal <strong>o</strong>n <strong>S</strong>ilicon (LCOS), <strong>S</strong>patial <strong>L</strong>ight<br>
<strong>M</strong>odulators (SLMs). This page is my attempt to share a little of what<br>
I've learned, because it is such a cool technology that I hope others<br>
get to work with.</p>
<h1>1 What is an LCOS SLM?</h1>
<p>There are two acronyms here, so I will break it down into its composite<br>
parts before I piece everything back together.</p>
<h2>1.1 Liquid Crystals</h2>
<p>We all know that liquids are substances without any structure, the<br>
molecules are free to move around, and don't have any structure. A<br>
crystal on the other hand, has a lot of structure, it is a substance<br>
with a structure that repeats in one, two or three dimensions (or four<br>
if you count <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_crystal">time crystals</a><br>
). Bringing the two concepts together, liquid crystals are a substance<br>
with a loosely repeating structure, where molecules are free to jostle,<br>
twist, and rotate, but not break out of their structure.</p>
<p>The molecular structure of the liquid crystals we are interested in<br>
gives it another trick that makes it useful for our applications. If we<br>
consider the MBBA molecule:</p>
<p><img src="LiquidCrystalDiagram.png" alt="Chemical Diagram of the MBBA Molecule"></p>
<p>It has a long rod-like structure, AND a free electron that is able to<br>
move up and down the length of the molecule uninterrupted. This electron<br>
makes the substance both electrically and optically active.</p>
<p>Putting all this together, liquid crystals are long, rod shaped<br>
molecules who arrange themselves in a repeating lattice with both<br>
electrical and optical responses.</p>
<p><img src="LCLattice.png" alt="Lattice of Liquid Crystals"></p>
<h3>1.2.1 Electrical Properties of Liquid Crystals {#electrical-properties}</h3>
<p>As a result of that free electron, when we expose a liquid crystal<br>
lattice to an electric field, the molecules will rotate, re-orienting<br>
themselves to point in the same direction of the electric field. This<br>
means that by applying a voltage, we can control the axis or the<br>
direction of our liquid crystal.</p>
<h3>1.2.2 Optical Properties of Liquid Crystals {#optical-properties}</h3>
<p>That free electron also affects the optical properties of the light.<br>
This is because light is an electro-magnetic field, so the free electron<br>
will oscillate in harmony with the electric field of any light that<br>
passes through it, this slows down the speed of light through the<br>
substance. There is a catch though, that electron can only run up and<br>
down the length of the molecule, so if the molecule is not totally in<br>
the same axis as the electric field of the light, the effect will be<br>
reduced. That means that the refractive index of the substance (the<br>
speed which light moves through it), is determined by the the angle the<br>
light hits the crystal at.</p>
<p>This is important, because slowing down light is how we bend it. Imagine<br>
when you are driving a car, and your left tyre is slowed by a puddle,<br>
making you veer left. When light hits a slow patch at an angle it bends.<br>
This is how lenses (like the ones in your glasses works.)</p>
<h2>1.2 Silicon</h2>
<p>Now that we have gotten liquid crystals out of the way, lets talk about<br>
silicon technology. Undoubtedly computers have changed the world, but<br>
convenient side effect for us that work in optics, is that the computer<br>
revolution has resulted in cheap, high quality semiconductor<br>
manufacturing. So any time we can exploit silicon technology for optics,<br>
we jump on the opportunity.</p>
<p>In order to control those liquid crystals I described above, we sandwich<br>
the liquid crystal between a silicon chip and a conductive transparent<br>
top glass. The silicon chip lets us apply a custom voltage anywhere in<br>
the x-y plane. That is, we can create an arbitrary electric field<br>
pattern across the liquid crystal.</p>
<h1>2 Putting it all together {#putting-together-the-first-word}</h1>
<p>After all that, we are ready to understand what the device does. An LCoS<br>
is a device that allows you to apply any refractive index profile you<br>
want in an x-y plane. It does this by creating an arbitrary electric<br>
field profile using silicon chip technology, and placing liquid crystals<br>
within that field, whose refractive index is a function electric field<br>
strength. This contraption allows you modulate the phase of incoming<br>
light in space. This is why we call them a <strong>Spatial Light Modulator</strong>.</p>
<p>In simple English. This is a lens, that we can reshape into any optical<br>
configuration from a computer.</p>
<h1>3 Applications</h1>
<p>There are a surprising number of applications for LCOS SLMs, from Beam<br>
Steering, to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.2078">photographing through walls and around<br>
corners</a>, but I want to talk about<br>
digital holography for now.</p>
<h2>3.1 Digital Holography</h2>
<p>Using spatial light phase modulation, we can use an SLM to create a real<br>
life holograms. The required necessary phase map to create a given<br>
hologram's amplitude map can be calculated using the Gerchburg Saxton<br>
Algorithm.</p>
<p>This algorithm creates a phase profile, which when light propagates<br>
through, creates constructive interference at the desired points in 3D<br>
space, and deconstructively interferes everywhere else.</p>
<p>Below you can see a hologram I built in the lab. The photo fails to do<br>
it justice. If I were to move the box forward or backwards, the hologram<br>
would disappear, since it was programmed to appear at that specific<br>
point in space. It would have worked better if I had a smoke machine on<br>
hand.</p>
<p><img src="PhySocHologram.png" alt="Hologram of the word PHYSOC projected onto a carboard
box"></p>
<h3>3.1.1 Holographic Optical Tweezers</h3>
<p>Aside from cool sci-fi implications of real life holograms replacing<br>
zoom calls, I would like to highlight one especially cool application of<br>
Computer Generated Holograms and LCOS SLMs, and that is Optical<br>
Tweezers. This effect relies on the fact that light has momentum. By<br>
exploiting this fact, we can use CGH to create a donut shaped light<br>
intensity profile, and use the momentum contained within this profile to<br>
pick up and move around small objects. This is super useful for things<br>
like neuron cells, which tend to respond poorly to being picked up by<br>
glass pipettes. Holographic Optical Tweezers offer a comparatively<br>
gentle experience for the cells. This concept is used with some<br>
regularity within biological research and is a commercial product<br>
offered by <a href="https://www.meadowlark.com/3d-holographic-optical-tweezing-kit/">Meadowlark Polarisation<br>
Optics</a>.<br>
You can see a demonstration below, where particles only 4.5 micrometers<br>
are being manipluated by such a device. <img src="HolographicOpticalTweezers.png" alt="A microscope photograph of
microparticels aranged as numbers
1-9"></p>
<h2>3.2 Spy Stuff</h2>
<p>It turn out, the only difference between white paint and a mirror, is<br>
that white paint isn't very smooth. It reflects all the colours the<br>
same as a mirror, but scatters the light - reflecting it at different<br>
angles and distances.</p>
<p>This is where the LCOS comes in again, if the light has been scattered<br>
by the white paint, we can use an LCOS to undo that distortion, and<br>
reconstruct an image. This is what <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.2078">these<br>
researchers</a> figured out, where they<br>
were able to take photos around corners by photographing white paint,<br>
and through &quot;privacy&quot; glass. <img src="lookingAroundCorners.png" alt="extract of a scientific paper, showing
the pheomena"> Credit: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.2078">Katz, O.<br>
(2012)</a></p>
<h1>4 Conclusion</h1>
<p>I hope you enjoyed this short introduction to my niche area of interest.<br>
There are plenty of cool applications for LCoS in the world of research<br>
and engineering, and if you ever get the chance to work with the, I<br>
would highly recommend it.</p>

      <title>From Student To Industry</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>2024-07-28 Note:</strong> This is a transcript for a talk I delivered to<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/joelacarpenter">Joel Carpenter's</a> UQ<br>
Optics class in 2022. I found it in my notes and did not bother to<br>
re-read it before uploading. Feel free to yell at me if I've made any<br>
mistakes.</p>
<h1>From Student To Industry</h1>
<p>Good afternoon everyone, my name is Cameron, I am a somewhat recent hire<br>
at Finisar, so I was sitting in your seat only a few years ago. Today I<br>
am going to talk about some of the things I noticed going from studying<br>
to working, some of the things I found helped with the transition and<br>
finding a job in industry and some of the things I might've done<br>
differently if I was going to do it again.</p>
<p>So to begin with, I want to talk about some of the differences I've<br>
noticed moving from being a student in academia to working in industry<br>
so that you have the right idea about what to expect.</p>
<p>The biggest difference I've noticed after moving from being a science<br>
student to working in industry is the shear breadth of things I need to<br>
do. If your science degree is anything like mine was, an average day was</p>
<ol>
<li>Sit in a lecture</li>
<li>Write some Notes</li>
<li>Write some MATLAB</li>
<li>Send one email,</li>
<li>Take more notes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Working as an engineer I find myself still doing lots of math and<br>
writing lots of software, but I'm also debugging electronic circuit<br>
boards, setting up experiments, designing metalwork, designing<br>
packaging, troubleshooting for customers and all kinds of related tasks.<br>
On the other hand, I also spend a LOT more time, filling in paperwork,<br>
answering emails, filling in more paperwork and also getting my hands<br>
dirty with the production crew make sure product <em>actually</em> gets out the<br>
door.</p>
<p>So there are pros and cons to it like anything, in both academia and<br>
industry there are plenty of time wasting tasks to get through, but<br>
having a physical product that you can hold in your hands and sell to<br>
customers for money I find to be really quite rewarding about working in<br>
industry. Especially after spending so many years where the sum of my<br>
work was a grade sheet at the end of semester.</p>
<p>On the hand, the other consequence of working on a physical product, is<br>
it actually needs to work. Every Time. When your in the lab your<br>
experiment only needs to work long enough to take your measurements, but<br>
for a physical product it needs to work every day, at a wide temperature<br>
range and under all kinds on conditions. Finding and addressing the<br>
corner cases in your products is its own special breed of hair pulling<br>
out.</p>
<p>So now I want to talk about what was useful an d useless that I got out<br>
of my degree.</p>
<p>It should go without saying that the foundations of mathematics and the<br>
skills associated with it are critical for understanding the underlying<br>
principals of any product you might design. Unfortunately, about 90% of<br>
the content you learn in math is useless. And I say that without<br>
exaggeration. I have not done a single proof since graduating. That is<br>
not to say that your math classes are useless, I often find myself<br>
writing software to implement some algorithm or another, which requires<br>
a good grasp on the elements of linear algebra, calculus, differential<br>
equations and all that other good stuff. The point I am trying to make<br>
here, is that a solid understanding of the fundamentals and how to apply<br>
them are a lot more useful than the expertise in any particular area of<br>
mathematics.</p>
<p>On a similar note, the lab sessions in my undergrad course were a lot<br>
more useful than I gave them credit for at the time.</p>
<p>There is the great saying <em>&quot;The difference between theory and practice,<br>
is greater in practice than in theory&quot;</em> And in engineering, a<br>
theoretical product doesn't get you very far. ( Unless you work for a<br>
Silicon Valley start up :P )</p>
<p>The point is, knowing how to use the tools of the trade and set up an<br>
experiment is one of the more useful things that your degree will<br>
directly teach you. Messing around with lasers, electronics,<br>
oscilloscopes and whatever else is in your lab is the most expensive<br>
part of your degree. So try to get your money's worth.</p>
<p>Now I want to talk about what I did right, and what I wish I did<br>
differently.</p>
<p>For one, I think the most valuable part of my degree of all my work was<br>
the open-ended research opportunities. I was fortunate enough to get the<br>
chance to do different research projects before starting my honors<br>
research. And even though none of this work nearly of publishable<br>
quality, this is where I learnt to work independently, and problem solve<br>
without the benefit of textbooks or lecturers who I could go to for<br>
clues. It also gave me some projects which I could talk when I was<br>
applying for jobs which differentiated me from the pack. If you have<br>
done primary research on a topic that's something an interviewer can ask<br>
you about and you can use it as an excuse to exercise your communication<br>
skills to talk about how you lead a project working independently (or in<br>
a team) and got actionable data from. See how many job keywords I<br>
slipped in there? So my recommendation, any chance you get to do some<br>
open ended research, jump on it!</p>
<p>For what I wish I did differently, I wish that I had got my hands dirty<br>
with a few more physical projects. Now in the <em><strong>unprecedented times</strong></em><br>
of covid, I found some of my <em>non-theoretical</em> skills were lacking, and<br>
that was a steep learning curve for me upon entering engineering.<br>
Labwork really helps here, but it was not quite enough. And if I might<br>
give some specific advice; if you are worried your physical skills are<br>
lacking like mine were, go buy yourself an Arduino Starter kit, they're<br>
relatively cheap and you can go get some experience with circuitry,<br>
embedded software, and project design. I also happen to think they're<br>
quite fun to tinker with, but it's VERY useful to have a physical<br>
<strong>THING</strong> you can say you made when applying to jobs. Remember, industry<br>
cares about selling things, not your grades.</p>
<p>Another idea for something to differentiate yourself from the pack. If<br>
you are a software person, consider contributing to an open-source<br>
project, even if its just correcting some typos in the documentation to<br>
start off with,</p>
<p>Having something of a portfolio you can show at an interview is<br>
invaluable, whether it is a physical <strong>thing</strong> you made, software you<br>
wrote or research you produced, having something unique that you did<br>
speaks a lot louder than the grades you get on your exams and assignment<br>
worksheets.</p>
<p>Another thing to put in the win column was all the hours I spent hanging<br>
out in the engineering department. I noticed very early on in my degree,<br>
that although I was studying pure science, the engineers always threw<br>
way better parties. So naturally that is where I spent all my free time.<br>
Now in addition to learning about the deep rivalry between mechanical<br>
and aeronautical engineering and deep philosophical questions such as<br>
&quot;Is civil engineering, really a type of engineering?&quot; spending time with<br>
this cohort was invaluable to my development.</p>
<p>This all boils down to idea cross-pollination, by making sure I was<br>
speaking to people outside of my department, I was exposing myself to<br>
more ideas. This meant I was better able to talk to people outside of my<br>
specialty, - (seriously, if you can't explain what it is your studying<br>
to a lay person, you will have problems explaining to an interviewer why<br>
they should hire you). - I was also able to get a better idea of what<br>
technologies other people were using and what scientific problems really<br>
need solving. For the engineers, speaking to us scientists they get some<br>
nice spoilers for upcoming technology and new ideas for development. So,<br>
the benefits really goes both ways.</p>
<p>Now while I've focused on our friends in engineering, I this idea<br>
generalizes quite broadly, if you want to know what products make a<br>
business profitable and which are a big-time waster, you're probably<br>
going to have to speak to the business students. There are fantastic<br>
ideas coming out of the mathematics and computer science departments<br>
every day which make for more useful research tools, and if you want to<br>
know what life is really worth living for, I guess that's what the arts<br>
department is for. Idea cross pollination and diversity of thought and<br>
mindset are incredibly important for your development professionally,<br>
the ideas you come up with and for your general social and emotional<br>
wellbeing.</p>
<p>To summarize the first half on my presentation, here are some action<br>
points: - Working in industry you may find yourself doing a much broader<br>
variety of tasks, but just as many time-wasting tasks - At the end of<br>
the day, you end up with a physical thing you can hold in your hands and<br>
sell for money, which I think is rewarding, however your milage may<br>
vary. - Math knowledge is useless, math skills are critical - Pay more<br>
attention in lab - Do something different to your cohort: - Chase down<br>
some open-ended research project - Build something with an Arduino -<br>
Contribute to an Open-Source Software project - Finally, try your best<br>
to socialize with people outside of your department, make sure you get<br>
used to explaining your work and understanding the work of others.</p>

      <description>What even is an espresso?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>1 Anatomy of the Espresso</h1>
<p>There are dozens of methods of brewing coffee, from the humble filter,<br>
plunger, aeropress and cold brew. But here in Australia, when we hear<br>
&quot;coffee&quot;, we think espresso. There is a lot of mysticism around coffee<br>
culture and the espresso, so as a coffee enthusiast and a nerd, I figure<br>
it is my responsibility to help out.</p>
<p>There are two factors which set Espresso apart from other methods of<br>
coffee brewing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Constant water flow</li>
<li>High-Pressure extraction.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's explore what these two things mean for our coffee below.</p>
<h2>1.1 Flow</h2>
<p>Unlike immersion methods like the plunger, where the coffee is immersed<br>
in a fixed batch of hot water, espresso cycles fresh water through the<br>
coffee at a constant rate. This results in more efficient extraction.<br>
Imagine trying to dissolve your milo, the more milo is already in<br>
solution the harder it is to dissolve any more. So by cycling fresh<br>
water through the coffee grinds, we make it easier for that water to<br>
dissolve the flavour compounds in the water.</p>
<p><img src="/blogs/FlowVsImmersion.svg" alt="Diagramm of the difference between Flow and Immersion"></p>
<h2>1.2 Pressure</h2>
<p>While plenty of other methods use flow (e.g. filter coffee), Espresso<br>
stands alone in using high pressure to maximise extraction. Using high<br>
pressure extraction further maximises the ability of the water to<br>
dissolve the flavour compounds.</p>
<p>The combination of these two factors is what allows the incredibly rich<br>
and concentrated nature of the espresso, and it is these factors we keep<br>
in mind when exploring how espresso works.</p>
<h1>2 Flavour</h1>
<h2>2.1 Taste and Aromatics</h2>
<p>Like many natural products (e.g. beer and wine) it is important to<br>
consider taste and flavour differently. Taste is the 5 basic tastes,<br>
sweet, salt, acid, umami, and bitter. While flavour is the complex<br>
interaction between taste, aroma and texture. Think of it like the<br>
difference between citric acid and a juicy lemon.</p>
<h3>2.1.1 Taste</h3>
<p>The primary taste profile of Espresso is salt and a balance of sour and<br>
bitter, with just a small amount of sweetness. Taste in an Espresso is<br>
optimised by balancing its extraction while maximising its strength.</p>
<h3>2.1.2 Aromatics</h3>
<p>Aromatics are the parts of the flavour that aren't the sense of taste,<br>
or texture. When a coffee says it tastes like stone fruit they are<br>
talking about the Aromatics.</p>
<p>Aromatics are experienced through our sense of smell. The pharynx is the<br>
tube that connects our mouth to our nose. It is what got filled up that<br>
time you laughed so hard that spaghetti came out of your nose, but it is<br>
also what lets us experience the smell of food while we are eating.</p>
<p>In coffee, the compounds responsible for aromatic expression are Esters,<br>
alcohols and Phenols. These highly volatile compounds freely evaporate<br>
allowing us to smell them, but are also very sensitive to changes in<br>
their environment.</p>
<h2>2.2 Extraction and Strength</h2>
<p>The difference between a good espresso and a bad espresso is the balance<br>
of its extraction and its strength.</p>
<p><img src="/blogs/CoffeeDiagram.svg" alt="Description of SVG image"></p>
<h3>2.2.1 Extraction</h3>
<p>During an espresso's extraction, the flavour profile is not even<br>
throughout the shot. The most soluble products are extracted first,<br>
while the less soluble are extracted after.</p>
<p>Typically the early fraction is acidic, tasting sour, brightly coloured,<br>
a warm honeycomb, and carries the oils and oil soluble Aromatics.</p>
<p>The later fractions are the near inverse. They are alkaline, tasting<br>
bitter, very darkly coloured like dark chocolate, and carries out the<br>
water soluble salts and aromatics.</p>
<p>An &quot;over-extracted&quot; espresso is characterised by a burnt and ashy taste.<br>
When people complain that their coffee is &quot;burned&quot; it is normally<br>
over-extracted.</p>
<p>Therefore, a &quot;balanced&quot; espresso is one which balances the bitter<br>
alkaline with the sour acid to reach a point where they approximately<br>
cancels out and is not too bitter or sour.</p>
<h3>2.2.2 Strength</h3>
<p>While a balanced espresso is one where the right amount of soluble<br>
compounds are dissolved, a strong espresso is one which achieves this in<br>
as little water as possible (or more accurately, maximises the<br>
concentration of flavour per mL)</p>
<p>A strong Espresso is more viscous than water, owing to the significant<br>
fraction of oils suspended in the solution. This gives an Espresso its<br>
texture (or as the weirdos call it &quot;Mouthfeel&quot;)</p>
<h1>3 Parameters Baristas Measure and Control</h1>
<p>An espresso &quot;recipe&quot; is three numbers: 1. Dose 2. Yield 3. Time. When a<br>
barista wants to replicate the taste of espresso days apart, they<br>
attempt to replicate these numbers.</p>
<h3>3.1.1 Dose</h3>
<p>Dose is quite simply the amount of coffee which goes into the basket<br>
before you extract.</p>
<p>Increasing the dose does two things. 1. Increase the strength 2.<br>
Increase the resistance to flow, increasing extraction</p>
<p>Point 1 is quite simple to understand, the higher the dose-to-yield<br>
ratio, the more concentrated the Espresso will be. Point number 2 is a<br>
little more complicated though. By adding more coffee to the basket, it<br>
increases the resistance to the pressure applied by the machine,<br>
resulting in a longer extraction time. Read on to see how this affects<br>
things.</p>
<h3>3.1.2 Yield</h3>
<p>While dose is how much coffee grind you put in, yield is how much<br>
Espresso we pull out. Increasing the yield will change the coffee by. 1.<br>
Increasing the extraction 2. Decreasing the strength</p>
<p>Since dissolving things into solution, is a chemical equilibrium<br>
process, sometimes the barista might add extra water to squeeze out that<br>
last bit of flavour.</p>
<h3>3.1.3 Time</h3>
<p>The time is quite simply how long it takes to pull the shot. This final<br>
variable is where the art of espresso is revealed. Because while the<br>
barista controls the dose and yield, they do not have any control over<br>
how long the espresso takes to extract. This is something they can only<br>
measure.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, for a fixed dose and yield, an increased time will<br>
result in higher extraction, since the water stays in contact with the<br>
coffee grinds for longer.</p>
<p>The time it takes to extract a shot is driven by the machine pressure<br>
and the coffee's resistance. Since the pressure is not something the<br>
barista changes during service, this leaves resistance as the variable.</p>
<p>Coffee's resistance itself varies with a number of factors including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grinder Settings</li>
<li>Grind Dose</li>
<li>Environmental Temperature</li>
<li>Humidity</li>
<li>Grinder Condition</li>
<li>Coffee's Age</li>
<li>Basket Geometry</li>
<li>And More!</li>
</ul>
<p>Of all the factors that affect resistance, the only ones under the<br>
barista's control are dose and coarseness. Since the other factors<br>
change over the course of the day, so will the coarseness have to change<br>
to account for these differences.</p>
<h1>4 Dialing in the espresso</h1>
<p>The process of making an espresso taste good, is the process of<br>
exploring the parameter space in order balance extraction and maximise<br>
strength, by adjusting dose, yield and grinder settings. .</p>
<h1>5 Conclusion</h1>
<p>And that's it! That is all the information you need to know to<br>
understand what the hell those weird coffee nerds are talking about, or<br>
maybe level up your own coffee :)</p>

      <title>RSS For Reddit</title>
      <description>Learn how to use RSS to improve your Reddit experience by subscribing to subreddits anonymously and avoiding the Infinite Sludge Algorithm.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> I built a widget to generate the feed url for you. See it <a href="/reddit-rss.html">here</a></p>
<h1>1 How and Why to Use RSS to Improve Your Reddit UX</h1>
<p>Did you know you can subscribe to subreddits via RSS? Maybe you did, but did you know it’s the best way to use Reddit without getting sucked into the Enshittified Torment Nexus™️?</p>
<p>It seems like it's only a matter of time before reddit plugs that gap to force you further into the enshittified platform. One last dance on Aaron Swartz's grave. So lets make the most of it while the feeds still exist.</p>
<p>If you don't know the Good News about RSS. Go and check out Cory Doctorow's <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/16/keep-it-really-simple-stupid/#read-receipts-are-you-kidding-me-seriously-fuck-that-noise">blogpost</a>, and then come back.</p>
<h2>1.1 Why You Might Want to Use RSS to Browse Reddit</h2>
<p>Reddit has fallen deeply down the enshittification black hole. It's been sliding that way for a while, but the API changes and public acquisition clearly made everything much worse.</p>
<h3>1.1.1 The Infinite Sludge Algorithm</h3>
<p>Reddit has adopted the same mindset as its other social media competitors: the Infinite Sludge Algorithm. It wants to present you with an endless flow of sludge content, regardless of whether you actually subscribed to see it, just to keep your eyes on their platform for as long as possible.</p>
<p><em>Who cares what subreddits you subscribed to? Here's some other content we think you'll like.</em></p>
<p>This is what makes reddit so aweful these days. I want social communities, but I don't want the website which facilitates that community to purposely make itself addictive.</p>
<h3>1.1.2 Tracking</h3>
<p>They're obviously tracking you. How else are they going to personalize your sludge?</p>
<h2>1.2 How Can RSS Save Your Reddit Experience?</h2>
<p>Using RSS, you can subscribe to <em>only</em> the communities you want to hear from and browse them anonymously until you choose to open them in your browser to interact.</p>
<p>No more endless algorithm of slop. Just the content you previously decided you wanted to see.</p>
<h1>2 How Do I do it?</h1>
<h2>2.1 Get Everything With No Sorting</h2>
<p>You can simply add <code>.rss</code> to the end of any subreddit URL to get an RSS feed of that subreddit's most recent posts. For example:</p>
<p><code>https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA.rss</code></p>
<h2>2.2 Okay, but Sorting by New Sucks</h2>
<p>Yes, it does. Unfortunately, RSS doesn't have any concept of &quot;Upvote,&quot; so there isn’t an RSS option to sort by &quot;hot.&quot; You can make use of Reddit’s URLs though, because you can add <code>.rss</code> to <em>any</em> URL. Here’s how I use it:</p>
<p><strong>Sort by top, limit to 5 (or however many) posts:</strong><br>
Example: <code>https://reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/top/.rss?limit=5</code> This will create an RSS feed of the top 5 most upvoted posts in <code>/r/3DPrinting</code> today, returned in reverse chronological order.</p>
<p>I did this for the 5 or so Reddit communities I actually want to keep track of, and now have my own Reddit feed with a hard cap on the top 30 posts from the past 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Why Use the limit argument:</strong> Even when you sort by <code>/top</code> your RSS reader will still list the top 25 (or however many) results in chronological order, leaving you back at square one. That's why I prefer to use <code>/top</code> and <code>?limit</code> to get <em>just</em> the top 5 in my feed.</p>
<p><strong>Other Filters:</strong>  You can also filter by their other sorting algorithms, e.g. rising <code>https://reddit.com/r/technology/rising/.rss</code> or if you are insane, by controversial <code>https://reddit.com/r/politics/controversial/.rss</code></p>
<p><strong>Private RSS Feeds</strong>: You can even subscribe to an RSS feed for your entire accounts front page! The Old Reddit website still has options for your private feeds <a href="https://www.reddit.com/prefs/feeds/">Reddit Private RSS Feeds</a> from here you can get an RSS feed of your front page as well as your inbox, or moderator options.</p>
<p><em>Considering these options only seem to appear on Old Reddit, I am not sure how much longer they will be supported. Lets See</em></p>
<h1>3 Wrapping Up</h1>
<p>Using RSS to browse reddit is the best of both worlds – I don't need to quit Reddit and leave those communities but I can still avoid getting sucked into the Enshittified Torment Nexus™️.</p>
<p>Give it a shot. Your sanity might just thank you for it.</p>
<h2>3.1 Example RSS links</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>https://reddit.com/r/technology/.rss</code></li>
<li><code>https://reddit.com/r/politics/controversial/.rss</code></li>
<li><code>https://reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/top/.rss?limit=5</code></li>
</ul>

        <p>I knew Facebook did shady shit beforehand but the degree to which and the amount they knew that they were doing still managed to shock me. the metaphor the title implies, a reference to the Great Gatsby is extremely apt. The belligerence with which the Facebook leadership acted kind of blew me away. On the other hand, it is important to remember that this is and ex employee with an extra grind and she is bringing out all the dirty laundry. Personally, I tend to take a structural analysis point of view when talking about the problems with companies like Facebook. That Cory doctorow point about how the current cup of execs are not uniquely stupid or evil. They are just enabled by stupid laws. The book doesn&#39;t explore any of this, as far as Williams is concerned, the leadership at Facebook is uniquely evil and uncaring. 
 I remember when I had to study Great Gatsby in high school, we had to discuss the degree to which our narrator was a reliable narrator. Because he was enjoying all the same spoils as the people he was criticizing. I wonder about Williams. If she wasn&#39;t sexually harassed and bullied out of her job, I wonder how critical she would be of Facebook. Would she have still been a whistleblower if she wasn&#39;t treated so horribly by the people in charge? I don&#39;t know, maybe.

        <p>This ends up feeling like one of those documentaries about flat Earth consspiracy theorests, except the nutjobs in question are Peter Theil, Sam Altman and Venture Captialists. I found it frustrating at some points because of the ammount of time it spends debunking obviously stupid ideas. It definately brought up some insights into ideology of some of these people, but the book felt a little bit too long IMHO. The ideology it describes is so incoherent that I find myself wondering how useful understanding it really is. If the actions of longtermist effective altruists are indistinguishable from a selfish asshole, then I wonder why not just apply Occam&#39;s Razor and assume they are just selfish assholes?

        <p>*If you willingly read the finance stories in the news or know a bit about personal finance, you can probably skip this book. But I would highly recommend buying for any teenagers or twenty-somethings in your life. (I know I would have liked to have read it earlier in my life.) 

It ends up being closer to a personal finance book than an economica book. Its insights arnt really anything I hadn&#39;t heard before, BUT it is well written, Kohler is a funny guy, and it&#39;s lessons are absolutely important (I just happened to know most of them beforehand)

side note: this book also is extremely Australian and for Australian audiences. (a rare thing I&#39;m this world). by that, I don&#39;t mean he is talking about riding your kangaroo to school, but instead he discusses reasonable rates for you superfund and how pokies impacts Aussies specifically

        <p>It is embarrassing for me to  admit that I work in the  &#34;Space Industry&#34; but I barely know anything about space history, so I picked up this one.It was one of the most compelling non-fiction books I have ever read. It felt like reading a thriller. I swear I could hear the intense music kick in once I got to the chapter about the SRB O-rings. If you know you know. At a bit over 500 pages it is a bit of a commitment, but the breadth and depth of his reasearch was fantastic.

        <p>This was a great read as a physicist. The book was written with quite a high level of assumed knowledge, so if thermodynamics sounds like a scary word, I might suggest reading something more accessible. For me though, the premise was very interesting and prompted me to go and read a number of the papers cited in the book. From what I can tell, the central concept of &#34;Assembly Theory&#34; is somewhat controversial in Astrobiology circles, so I am not sure I am fully on board with the idea, but it is very interesting to engage with and think about. The book has me thinking a lot about the distinction between systems with selection, random systems and designed systems. I may have to write another blogpost about these ideas. Maybe one about Assembly Theory as well.

        <p>I was maybe a little bit more educated than the target audience for the book, because I found a lot of the points made a little bit obvious, and I was waiting for new information. The book is well written however, and has a very nice flow to it. I listened to it as an audiobook, so even got to listen to Aleksik perform the accents he was describing. Aleksik seems to be more optimistic about our algorithm future than I am, and I am not sure he convinced me. (I may just be cranky and cynical however). The one point I can confidently state that I disagree with: I think Aleksik overstates the effect of accents, because I think he over-estimates the proportion of posters-to-consumers on social media. I cannot see how a micro-cultural accent can occur when the line of communication is mostly mono-directional.

        <p>The review they stick in the front describes it as &#34;Part western, part Greek tragedy&#34; and I think that is a really good description.

        <p>Fair warning, this is straight up propaganda (it even had to pass MI5 clearance to publish) and is written like Tom Clancy. Nonetheless, it was really enjoyable to read. The narrative of it is mostly in the form of radio chatter which is a form I personally find gripping. Also kind of terrrifying to think how many terror plots get stopped, but it restored some level of my faith in instituitions to see the principaled stance that Tom and his team operated within.

      <title><![CDATA[Book Review: Everything Is Tuberculosis by John Green]]></title>

        <p>I never read John Green&#39;s YA fiction, since I was not a &#34;YA&#34; when I first came across it, BUT, I absolutely adored Crash Course History, and the way John thinks on Vlog Brothers. With this in mind, &#34;Everything is Tuberculosis&#34; is everything I hoped for. He places the diseases in the context of human history and present day human culture. He ends the book arguing that Tuberculosis used to be caused by bacterial infection, now it is caused by injustice, and it is our job to fix it.

        <p>A bit of a slog to get through to be completely honest, but also incredibly important. The book tells the story of Australia through the lens of union action. Turns out almost all the institutions I like were thanks to unions. If you have ever said the words &#34;Bob Hawke and Keating were Neoliberals&#34; you should read this book to understand how that period of history really worked

        <p>this was a very accessible book on philosophy, i have previsoly struggled with a lot of &#34;traditional&#34; philosphy, e.g. netzsche and camus which who i&#39;ve attempted to read several times and keep bouncing off. admittedly, when i picked it up i was expecting a self-help book, turns out it was a philosophy of mind book. very worthwile anyway.

        <p>Blindsight falls into the club with the Matrix and the Three Body Problem, of being a piece of Sci-Fi who is primarily a piece of philosophy. It is a ***crunchy*** bit of sci-fi which explores transhumanism more thoroughly than any other piece I can think of. I have more thoughts which I will save for an extended blogpost I think.

        <p>This is a complicated one to recommend. It was a bit of a slog to read, and parts of it were quite confronting. Without going too much into my own political ideology, I don&#39;t think it would be that surprising to most that I do not agree 100% with the political opinions espoused by a general of the U.S military. That said, I do think it is worth a read. Not because I agree with all the opinions of the author, but because I think it is very important for many to understand how a general of the U.S. military thinks.

        <p>I&#39;ve readlly enjoyed his Youtube channel &#34;Gary&#39;s Economis&#34; for a while now. In that light I was slightly disappointed that the book was mostly biographic, with not a whole lot of economics. That said, Stevensen is a REALLY great writer. Lots of very funny anecdotes, and insights. Worth the read.

        <p>Varoufakis is a surprisingly great writer. The first chapter draws an extremely compelling extended metaphor between physics and philosphy and economics which blew me away. His core thesis is that we have moved beyond capitalism, and far from the socialist utopia which many predicted would be the downfall of capitalism, we ended up with something weird, and worse than capitalism. Very compelling read, and one of the more influential in how I currently percieve the world economy.

        <p>I found this to be less interesting than I hoped. Yep, if you work too hard you will burn out, and there are physiological signs. Idk, maybe some people need a book to tell them this, but I found it obvious and tedious

        <p>This book is GREAT. It had me absolutley obsessed with a topic I previously knew nothing about. The book is covers the bilogoy, ecology and biotechnology of algea. It somehow had me turning pages faster I could have possibly thought given the topic. By the end I was obsessed and looking at ingredients on the back of boxes to identify the algal products inside.

        <p>I really liked this one. It is a history of the last 20 years in Afghanistan, told biographically through the eyes of the authors collegues. This method of history is deeply personal, and I think an illuminating way to personally understand WHY things happened how they did in a sociological context.

        <p>This one was really good. The central premise is that humans are really bad at true randomness, and we fall into very predicatble patterns while trying to do random. The book then outlines the mistakes we tend to make (and practical advice in how you could exploit those blindspots)

        <p>Typically I am a very materialist (philosophically, not literally) person, and as a results this was one of the more impactful political books I have ever read. In many cases power is downstream from technology, and Doctorow expertly identifies the problems, their causes and their solutions. More than any other pice, this is a guidebook for the necessary changes to affect downstream changes.
