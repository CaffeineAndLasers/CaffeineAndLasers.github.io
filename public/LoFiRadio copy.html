    1 Announcing My LoFi Terminal Radio
</h1>
<p>
    This was a short weekend project I threw together to replace the perpetually
    open YouTube Tab for
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfKfPfyJRdk"
        >lofi beats to relax/study to</a
    >. The result? A minimalist audio player that does its job without any
    frills. Here's why I created it and how it works.
</p>
<h1 id="what-is-it">2 What is it</h1>
<p>
    In short, it is an audio player with a very specific emphasis on being: -
    minimalist - distraction-free You cannot select tracks, replay tracks or go
    to the next track. This is a feature, not a shortcoming. If you want
    different music, change the station.
</p>
<p>
    The aim of this is to provide an experience akin to radio. You can turn it
    on, change the volume and switch the channel, but the programming is up to
    the DJ.
</p>
<h1 id="why-design-it-like-this">3 Why Design it like this</h1>
<p>
    This program isn't to replace your spotify or main music player. Instead it
    is to replace your
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfKfPfyJRdk"
        >lofi beats to relax/study to</a
    >
    Youtube tab that stays open while you work. The channel has 15k streamers on
    it when I checked, and has streaming uninterrupted since July 2022.
</p>
<p>
    Why does this exist? Much like some art makes you think, and some exists
    just to decorate space. Some music exists to make you think, and some exist
    to decorate time. When you get these two types confused your "background
    music" can become the focus, distracting you from the work you are meant to
    be doing. These "lofi hip-hop" streams exist to play background music and
    remove the temptation of fiddling with the playlist.
</p>
<p>
    The problem is, a 1080p video stream running in a web browser is
    super-overkill for listening to music. It wastes network bandwidth, computer
    memory, and CPU cycles. On top of this, it removes the distraction of
    fiddling with playlists but replaces it with the visual clutter of an
    unnecessary browser tab next to your actual work
</p>
<h1 id="my-solution">4 My Solution</h1>
<p>
    A tool to replace this should have 1. No way to select tracks or configure
    playlists from the UI 2. Stay out of the way when you aren't using it
</p>
<p>
    For this, I settled on a discrete terminal app that I can stash neatly out
    of the way. Especially when I leave it running in my
    <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/6307/quake-terminal/"
        >Quake Terminal</a
    >
    extension for GNOME.

<h1 id="customising-it">6 Customising it</h1>
<h2 id="colours">6.1 Colours!</h2>
<p>
    The UI is determined by css, with the colours defined at the top of the
    file. Change your colour scheme to whatever you want just by changing the
    hex codes at the top of the css file.

<h2>6.2 Keybindings! </h2>
    Don't like vim? Iwon't hold it against you. There is a simple text file
    of the keybindings.  Change the key to whatever you need.
</p>
<h1 id="does-it-work-on">7 Does it work on:</h1>
<ul>
    <li>
        Linux
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Yes!</strong> I have tested it on two machines and a
                virtual machine
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Mac
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Probably!</strong> I haven't tested. Try it and let me
                know. I can't afford a Macbook.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Windows
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Eventually!</strong> There are some bugs specific to
                Window's implementation of Python. (Or maybe Linux's
                implementation?) Either way, it doesn't work as perfectly on
                Windows. It will be fixed when I get around to it.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h1 id="this-is-all-well-and-good-but-who-has-mp3-files-anymore">
    8 This is all well and good, but who has MP3 files anymore?
</h1>
<p>
    You got me there! Spotify support isn't really something I can be bothered
    messing with. Instead, I built my playlists from the Royalty Free resources
    available at <a href="https://pixabay.com/music/search/lofi/">Pixbay</a>,
    but for artists, you are genuinely fond of you can actually support them by
    buying their music through Bandcamp.
</p>
<h1 id="technical-details">9 Technical Details</h1>
<h2 id="frameworks">9.1 Frameworks</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Both the backend and UI are written in Python
        <ul>
            <li>Backend uses PyGame to handle the mp3 playback</li>
            <li>
                Frontend uses the Textual Framework to handle keybindings, and
                tcss for a css-like experience configuring the UI
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-it-works">9.2 How it works:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        The player process grabs a directory of mp3 files, and a playlist object
        grabs each file one at a time, and throws it at the player object when
        it needs a new song.
    </li>
    <li>
        A queue is used to pass commands from the UI in TUI.py, to the process
        in musicPlayer.py and messages back in the other direction.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="customisability">9.3 Customisability</h2>
<p>
    At the moment the application is optimised for my specific use case. And I
    am very opinionated. This means: -The entire program is controlled from the
    keyboard, with vim keybindings - No "Next" button is exposed in the UI.
</p>
<p>
    Thankfully, the frameworks used are very flexible, allowing for easy
    hackability. To change the colours of the UI, you only need to change the
    hexcodes in <code>style.tcss</code>. To add mouse support, you can easily
    implement buttons using Textualise's built-in widgets. In fact, the repo has
    a spare folder for GUI elements I designed, (then removed) to get you
    started.
</p>
<p>
    The process also already has a command written for the next track. You only
    need to add the UI element if you really want it.
</p>
<h1 id="future-changes">10 Future Changes</h1>
<p>
    Future changes are unlikely because it currently fits my use case. However
    for the sake of completeness, here is how I may extend the application. -
    Custom theming. - At the moment I have a Catpuccino theme hardcoded into it.
    An implementation to vary the colour scheme would be simple to implement and
    highly beneficial - Implement GUI and Mouse Support. - I have a soft spot
    for text-only UIs, which is why it is implemented like this. The framework
    does support buttons for mouse UIs though. The app does work with buttons
    but I thought they were ugly and removed them. Check the commit history for
    implementation -Old School animated music visualiser: - This is somewhat
    antithetical to the design philosophy, but they are a lot of fun. I plan on
    building one eventually.<br />
    - GUI Support Cont: Implement a list feature for all the stations.
</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">11 Conclusion</h1>
<p>
    The LoFi Terminal Radio aims to provide a distraction-free,
    resource-efficient alternative to streaming background music. If you're
    looking for a minimalist approach to your work soundtrack, give it a try!
    Feedback and contributions are always welcome.
